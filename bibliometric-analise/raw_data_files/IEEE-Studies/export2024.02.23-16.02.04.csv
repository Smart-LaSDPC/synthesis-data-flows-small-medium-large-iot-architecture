This can substantially expand the scope of applications, both in number and in value. But first, translation into applications requires a base of system functions (instrumentation, computation, power management, communication). These cannot be realized on the desired scale by large-area electronics alone. It is necessary to combine large-area electronics with high-performance, high-efficiency technologies, such as crystalline silicon CMOS, within hybrid systems. Scalable hybrid systems require rethinking the subsystem architectures from the start by considering how the technologies should be interfaced, on both a functional and physical level. To explore platform architectures along with the supporting circuits and devices, we consider as an application driver, a self-powered sheet for high-resolution structural health monitoring (of bridges and buildings). Top-down evaluation of design alternatives within the hybrid design space and pursuit of template architectures exposes circuit functions and device optimizations traditionally overlooked by bottom-up approaches alone.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2015.2399476","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1202168,CCF-1218206); Systems on Nanoscale Information fabriCs (SONIC); MARCO; DARPA; Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship; Harold W.

Additionally, exploiting the sparsity in the observation matrix induced by the over-the-air-aggregation-based multiple access, we propose a low-complexity 2-D message passing state estimation algorithm, where the cyclic loops in the 2-D factor graphs are removed based on the quasi-diagonal transformation of the aggregated channel matrix of the IoT sensors. As a result, the proposed state estimation scheme is of low complexity and can achieve exact maximum a posterior estimation. Using the Lyapunov drift analysis, we derive the closed-form necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the mission-critical remote state estimation system.

IoT applications running together with interconnected objects enable the vision of gathering data and based on that act in physical environments with minimal human intervention. Maintaining such IoT applications needs to incorporate different software and hardware components to build up the network of things that delivers the data of sensors and controls actuators. However, the effort of installation, configuration and management of a growing number of IoT devices increases the complexity of integrating such heterogeneous hard- and software. Automating the configuration of IoT devices, i.e., reducing the effort of configuring the devices in the target vicinity, reduces cost, complexity and the occurrence of errors. We propose the usage of automatically generated Scale-Out Plans on the basis of the OASIS standard TOSCA. The overall approach is based on the ability to mark regions inside TOSCA application models, that must be scaled out when new devices are registered for the overall application. From this marked model we generate Scale-Out Plans that are able to create instances of software components enabling the automated configuration of IoT devices.

The study will emphasize on, and use small-scale farmers and smallholder farms interchangeably. For the small-scale farmer to market and compete in national or regional market, they need huge investments such as modern technologies, modern transportation and storage facilities like in developed countries, which is financially challenging.

To address the related challenges, we have proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled spatial data sampling scheme in this paper using denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural network. More specifically, a UAV-enabled edge-cloud collaborative IoT system architecture is first developed for data processing in large-scale IoT monitoring systems, where UAV is utilized as mobile edge computing device. Based on this system architecture, the UAV-enabled spatial data sampling scheme is further proposed, where the wireless sensor nodes of large-scale IoT systems are clustered by a newly developed bounded-size K-means clustering algorithm. A neural network model, i.e., DAE, is applied to each cluster for data sampling and reconstruction, by exploitation of both linear and nonlinear spatial correlation among data samples.

However, due to the random deployment of sensor nodes (SNs), physical topology of the WSNs cannot be controlled and typically remains unknown to the IoT cloud server. Therefore, in order to derive the physical topology at the cloud for effective real-time event detection, a cloud-orchestrated physical topology discovery scheme for large-scale IoT systems using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed in this paper. More specifically, the large-scale monitoring area is first split into a number of subregions for UAV-enabled data collection. Within the subregions, parallel Metropolis-Hastings random walk (MHRW) is developed to gather the information of WSN nodes, including their IDs and neighbor tables. The collected information is then forwarded to the cloud through UAVs for the initial generation of logical topology. Thereafter, a network-wide 3-D localization algorithm is further developed based on the discovered logical topology and multidimensional scaling method (Topo-MDS), where the UAVs equipped with global positioning system are served as mobile anchors to locate the SNs. Simulation results indicate that the parallel MHRW improves both the efficiency and accuracy of logical topology discovery. In addition, the Topo-MDS algorithm dramatically improves the 3-D location accuracy, as compared to the existing algorithms in the literature.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2018.2796499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8265619","Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems;parallel Metropolis–Hastings random walk (MHRW);Physical topology discovery;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);wireless sensor networks (WSNs);3-D localization","Topology;Wireless sensor networks;Cloud computing;Three-dimensional displays;Peer-to-peer computing;Network topology;Wireless communication","","39","","24","IEEE","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analyzing and mining such big traffic data in massive IoT can help traffic administrations to make scientific and reasonable traffic scheduling decisions, so as to avoid prospective traffic congestions in the future. However, the above traffic decision making often requires frequent and massive data transmissions between distributed sensors and centralized cloud computing centers, which calls for lightweight data integrations and accurate data analyses based on large-scale traffic data.

Thus, the authors propose Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors (HEB), a paradigm that builds on the concepts of emergent behavior and hierarchical organization. Rather than explicitly programming all possible decisions in the vast space of ULSS scenarios, HEB relies on the emergent behaviors induced by local rules at each level of the hierarchy.

This work closes a previously identified gap of missing statistically significant sample sizes for testing the unpredictability of PUFs.

Recently, wireless-powered networks with backscatter communications (WPN-BCs) has been emerged as a most prominent technology for enabling large-scale self-sustainable wireless networks with the capabilities of RF energy harvesting (EH) and of extreme low power consumption. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive literature review on the fundamentals, challenges and the on-going research efforts in the domain of WPN-BCs. Our emphasis is on large-scale networks. In particular, we discuss signal processing aspects, network design issues and efficient communication techniques. Moreover, we review emerging technologies for WPN-BCs to bring about the best use of resources. Some applications of this innovative technology are also highlighted. Finally, we address some open research problems and future research directions.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2020.3012466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151232","Backscatter communication systems;wireless-powered networks;large-scale communication systems;IoT networks;massive machine type communications","Backscatter;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Receivers;RF signals;Wireless sensor networks","","46","","264","CCBY","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, we believe that blockchain technologies can be beneficial for data and resource management in large-scale internet of things (IoT) networks of smart cities. Blockchain technologies and their related consensus algorithms and miners may apply through multilevel information communication technology (ICT) architecture in large-scale IoT networks of smart cities to organize the city-data and ICT resources. This position paper addresses an initial idea about the contribution of different smart cities and ICT concepts, including “blockchain technologies,” “distributed-to-centralized ICT architecture (D2C-ICT),” “distributed-to-centralized data management (D2CDM),” and “smart university.” We first present our D2C-ICT architecture in the smart university context using different distributed and centralized technologies, including cloudlet and cloud technologies. Finally, we show that the facilities of blockchain technologies for data and resource management through D2C-ICT architecture in large-scale IoT networks of smart cities.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408072","Smart City;Smart University;large-scale IoT networks;blockchain technologies;distributed-to-centralized ICT architecture (D2C-ICT);distributed-to-centralized data management (D2C-DM)","Cloud computing;Smart cities;High performance computing;Data security;Distributed databases;Blockchain;Computer architecture","","","","60","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
