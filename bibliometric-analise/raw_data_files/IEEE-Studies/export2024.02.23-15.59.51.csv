Nowadays technologies transform many segments of human life. The Internet of things is becoming one of the most important information technologies that can change and has already changed the lives of people around the world. Under the Internet of Things (IoT) is understood the concept of a computer network that unites the most diverse devices, between which interaction is possible. These devices can also interact with the external environment without human participation or with minimal participation. The various components of the Internet of Things are widely used in everyday life. In addition, components of the Internet of things are actively being introduced into industrial processes. The functioning of the Internet of things is possible within the framework of many software and technology platforms. Many of them are developed and supported by large IT-corporations. On the one hand, this is a natural process, on the other hand, corporations can impose certain technological and software platforms to their users. These processes are unfolded in a post-consumer society, in which centers of political and economic power, through manipulative information-ideological and marketing strategies can influence on the life and choice of a person. It seems to us that within the Internet of things it is possible to develop software and technologies platforms through the efforts of local communities, small businesses, that is, decentralized and multiple structures as elements of civil society. In current conditions and at the local level, society itself can create technological and software platforms capable to solve a number of daily life tasks, influence on certain segments of political life, and form a social consensus on a local scale.","","978-1-5386-0539-4","10.1109/CCOMS.2017.8075284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8075284","internet;internet of things;philosoph;ontology;information technologies","Internet of Things;Sensors;Monitoring;Business;Software","","2","","8","IEEE","23 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems can be monitored and controlled by filtering and processing collected data. Such intelligent design will naturally result is efficient and cost effective systems. Several architectures are being built to implement IoT from two different perspectives. The first, also known as sensor-oriented, is based on large-scale sensors deployment targeting the collection of accurate sensory data. The second architecture, also known as service-oriented, targets the association of unique identifiers with specific services. In such architecture, the service is invoked upon receiving the unique identifier from a specific ID collecting node considering the context in which it was collected. The rise of ad hoc sensors, and new manifestations of sensing systems within the Internet of Things resulted in a tide of sensed data that is potentially drowning our communication resources. In this talk I overview the evolution of sensing systems as they contributed to Big Data, and outline the rising challenges in both communicating and understanding this data. I argue that a solution lies not in sensing systems alone, but in the expedited funneling and processing of data as we attempt to prune the unnecessary, and make sense of the valuable.

This creates a high demand for food, which is prompting the study of high quality and high-yielding crops. China's current agricultural production is sufficient to feed the nation; however, compared with developed countries agricultural farming is still lagging behind, mainly due to the fact that the system of growing agricultural crops is not based on maximizing output, the latter would include scientific sowing, irrigation and fertilization. In the past few years many seasonal fruits have been offered for sale in markets, but these crops are grown in traditional backward agricultural greenhouses and large scale changes are needed to modernize production. The reform of small-scale greenhouse agricultural production is relatively easy and could be implemented. The concept of the Agricultural Internet of Things utilizes networking technology in agricultural production, the hardware part of this agricultural IoT include temperature, humidity and light sensors and processors with a large data processing capability; these hardware devices are connected by short-distance wireless communication technology, such as Bluetooth, WIFI or Zigbee. In fact, Zigbee technology, because of its convenient networking and low power consumption, is widely used in the agricultural internet. The sensor network is combined with well-established web technology, in the form of a wireless sensor network, to remotely control and monitor data from the sensors.In this paper a smart system of greenhouse management based on the Internet of Things is proposed using sensor networks and web-based technologies. The system consists of sensor networks and asoftware control system. The sensor network consists of the master control center and various sensors using Zigbee protocols. The hardware control center communicates with a middleware system via serial network interface converters. The middleware communicates with a hardware network using an underlying interface and it also communicates with a web system using an upper interface. The top web system provides users with an interface to view and manage the hardware facilities ; administrators can thus view the status of agricultural greenhouses and issue commands to the sensors through this system in order to remotely manage the temperature, humidity and irrigation in the greenhouses. The main topics covered in this paper are:1. To research the current development of new technologies applicable to agriculture and summarizes the strong points concerning the application of the Agricultural Internet of Things both at home and abroad. Also proposed are some new methods of agricultural greenhouse management.2. An analysis of system requirements, the users' expectations of the system and the response to needs analysis, and the overall design of the system to determine it's architecture.3.

This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best.

A major challenge for these systems is how the Cloud of Things can handle the data generated from billions of connected IoT devices. Edge computing infrastructure offers a promising solution by operating as a middle layer between the IoT devices and cloud computing. The Edge of Things (EoT) can offer small-scale real-time computing and storage capabilities that ensures low latency and optimal utilization of the IoT resources.

This paper introduces a novel EoT computing framework for secure and smart healthcare surveillance services. Fully homomorphic encryption preserves data privacy and is stored and processed within an EoT framework. A distributed approach for clustering-based techniques is developed for the proposed EoT framework with the scalability to aggregate and analyze the large-scale and heterogeneous data in the distributed EoT devices independently before it is sent to the cloud.

A main idea behind our distributed IoT orchestration architecture is the intelligent partition of a real time IoT computing task into an optimal coordination of server-side processing and IoT object side processing. Second, a set of optimization techniques are introduced to limit the amount of computations handled by the edge clients and to enhance the overall performance and resource utilization of the ISYMPHONY system.

IoT devices need to report their data or status to base stations at various frequencies. The IoT communications observed by a base station normally exhibit the following characteristics: (1) massively connected, (2) lightly loaded per packet, and (3) periodical or at least mostly predictable. The current design principals of communication networks, when applied to IoT scenarios, however, do not fit well to these requirements. For example, an IPv6 address is 128 bits, which is much longer than a 16-bit temperature report. Also, contending to send a small packet is not cost-effective. In this work, we propose a novel framework, which is slot-based, schedule-oriented, and identity-free for uploading IoT devices' data. We show that it fits very well for IoT applications. The main idea is to bundle time slots with certain hashing functions of device IDs, thus significantly reducing transmission overheads, including device IDs and contention overheads. The framework is applicable from small-scale body-area (wearable) networks to large-scale massively connected IoT networks.

A way to achieve the purpose is sensor virtualization, discovery and data restitution. In this paper, a federation of FIT IoT-LAB within OpenIoT is presented. OpenIoT is a middleware that enables the collection of data streams from multiple heterogeneous geographically dispersed data sources, as well as their semantic unification and streaming with a cloud infrastructure. Future Internet of Things IoT-LAB (FIT IoT-LAB) provides a very large scale infrastructure facility suitable for testing small wireless sensor devices and heterogeneous communicating objects. The integration proposed represents a way to reduce the gap existing in the Internet of Things (IoT) fragmentation, and, moreover, allows users to develop smart city applications by interacting directly with sensors at different layers.

It is projected that by 2020 the number of connected devices is estimated to grow exponentially to 50 billion. The growing interest for the Internet of Things is contributing to the large-scale deployment of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). These networks support communications amongst sensor devices from the real world and their interconnection to the Internet. An open standard routing protocol called RPL has been specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in order to address the specific properties and constraints of these networks. However, this protocol is exposed to a large variety of attacks. Their consequences can be quite significant in terms of network performance and resources It is apparent that security will pose a fundamental enabling factor for the successful deployment and use of most IoT applications and in particular secure routing among IoT sensor nodes thus, mechanisms need to be designed to provide secure routing communications for devices enabled by the IoT.

The real potential of the IoT lies in facilitating largescale sharing of high-quality context-rich information through systems-of-IoT-systems, rather than IoT systems that operate as isolated technology silos. Real large-scale interoperability requires layers of standards, and each layer addresses different interoperability challenges. The SensorThings API data model seeks to tackle data interoperability at the data and informational layers of IoT platforms. SensorThings API is aligned to the ISO/OGC O&M data standard, and like O&M it is semi-structured. Semi-structured models allow for variance within implementations for different use-cases, which is both necessary and detrimental to systems interoperability.In this paper we propose that the SensorThings API data model should be defined as a set of archetypes, used to capture extensible domain concepts using a two-level modeling IoT systems design approach.

Consequently, the performance improvement in malware analysis is critical requirement to stop rapid expansion of malicious attacks in IoT environment. To solve this problem, the paper proposed a novel framework for classifying malware in IoT environment. To achieve flne-grained malware classification in suggested framework, the malware image classification system (MICS) is designed for representing malware image globally and locally. MICS first converts the suspicious program into the gray-scale image and then captures hybrid local and global malware features to perform malware family classification.

For a more effective big data analytic in large-scale IoT networks, reliable solutions are being designed such that many real-time decisions will be taken at the edge of the network close to where data is being generated. Gaussian functions are extensively applied in the field of statistical machine learning, pattern recognition, adaptive algorithms for function approximation, etc. It is envisaged that soon, some of these machine learning solutions and other gaussian function based applications that have low computation and low-memory footprint will be deployed for edge analytics in large-scale IoT networks. Hence, it will be of immense benefit if an adaptive, low-cost, method of designing gaussian functions becomes available. In this paper, gaussian distribution functions are designed using C28x real-time digital signal processor (DSP) that is embedded in the TMS320C2000 modem designed for powerline communication (PLC) at the low voltage distribution end of the smart grid, where numerous devices that generate massive amount of data exist. Open-source embedded C programming language is used to program the C28x for real-time gaussian function generation. The designed gaussian waveforms are stored in lookup tables (LUTs) in the C28x embedded DSP, and could be deployed for a variety of applications at the edge of the SG and IoT network. The novelty of the design is that the gaussian functions are designed with a generic, low-cost, fixed-point DSP, different from state of the art in which gaussian functions are designed using expensive arbitrary waveform generators and other specialized circuits. C28x DSP is selected for this design since it is already existing as an embedded DSP in many smart grid applications and in other numerous industrial systems that are part of the large scale IoT network, hence it is envisaged that integration of any gaussian function based solution using this DSP in the smart grid and other IoT systems may not be too challenging.","","978-9-5318-4235-8","10.23919/SMAGRIMET.2018.8369850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369850","digital signal processor;powerline communication;smart grid;machine learning;open-source;embedded C;big data","Gaussian distribution;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Machine learning;Table lookup;Modems;Matlab","","6","","24","","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most recent works on smart energy systems focus on the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. While renewable energy has been a key topic of research for decades, its adoption at large scale has been hindered by reliability and intermittency issues. Internet of Things can provide solutions to overcome such issues and enable grid integration by providing means for remote and real-time monitoring and performance analysis of solar facilities. This paper presents smart solar energy systems as an IoT application and derives primary system requirements of IoT middleware required for building efficient, scalable, and reliable grid-integrated large-scale and distributed smart solar farms.","","978-1-7281-2949-5","10.1109/IOTSMS48152.2019.8939251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939251","Internet of Things;distributed solar;PV;smart grid;IoT middleware","Internet of Things;Middleware;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Meteorology;Solar energy;Smart grids","","1","","46","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the multisource heterogeneity of IoT devices, there are significant differences between the vulnerability detection of the Internet of Things and the PC-based vulnerability search method. Therefore, determining how to accurate search for vulnerabilities in large-scale cross-platform binary executable files is an urgent problem to be solved. At present, the solution to this problem mostly calculates code similarities by generating a CFG (control flow graph) from binary code, but due to the choice of architecture, OS (operating system) or compilation options, the same source code will be compiled into different assembly codes. The performance of existing vulnerability search methods for cross-architecture binaries has been challenged. To alleviate the vast differences in the assembly codes caused by different compilation scenarios, this paper proposes a cross-platform large-scale binary vulnerability search method based on two-level feature semantic learning. The contribution is that we have defined a new functional structured signature method to mitigate the massive grammatical and structural differences of binary files caused by different compilation environments. Moreover, we reasonably integrate the hierarchical model of Structure2Vec and GAT (graph attention network) and implement training from the internal control flow characteristics of the function and the call relationship between functions to obtain a more accurate functional semantic expression.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953173","National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2016YFB08011601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920168","IoT;cross-platform;binary vulnerability;structured signature;deep learning","Feature extraction;Semantics;Optimization;Search problems;Robustness;Data models;Data mining","","3","","47","CCBY","3 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To mitigate this problem and achieve a high uplink throughput we use Cell-Free systems with optimal LMMSE channel estimation, while traditionally simple suboptimal estimators have been used in such systems. We further derive an analytical SINR expression for this scenario, which depends only on large scale fading coefficients.

These devices are irregularly interconnected, with heterogeneous characteristics and construct a large-scale IoT system. Thus, the operation of each device becomes more important, so a malfunction can be propagated along the connection and affect the whole system. In addition, IoT devices have a constraint, in that they do not receive enough power in an unstable environment operating at the edge of the environment and they operate in a variety of environments. For these reasons, it is necessary to monitor variously the IoT system, which has irregular connectivity and changes critical sections of logic every time because of various operations. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose an optimized low-power reconfigurable Fault-Safe Processor (FSP) platform based on RISC-V for large-scale IoT-driven applications that can construct an optimized IoT system after considering numerous connectivity and operation sequences of processors.

To address the related challenges, we have proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled spatial data sampling scheme in this paper using denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural network. More specifically, a UAV-enabled edge-cloud collaborative IoT system architecture is first developed for data processing in large-scale IoT monitoring systems, where UAV is utilized as mobile edge computing device. Based on this system architecture, the UAV-enabled spatial data sampling scheme is further proposed, where the wireless sensor nodes of large-scale IoT systems are clustered by a newly developed bounded-size K-means clustering algorithm. A neural network model, i.e., DAE, is applied to each cluster for data sampling and reconstruction, by exploitation of both linear and nonlinear spatial correlation among data samples.

Due to the high cost of pipeline opening and inaccessibility of the pipeline network in remote regions, small-scale liquified natural gas (LNG) distribution in local areas has become a popular gas distribution pattern. However, existing solutions mainly focus on the distribution between LNG receiving stations and end users with large gas storage volumes, ignoring the increasingly large number of end users with small gas storage volumes. Furthermore, traditional communication approaches, such as telephone and SMS, between the end users and the gas distributors are still prevailing, which results in not only huge workload but also inefficiency and even gas depletion. This paper presents a small-scale liquified natural gas distribution system using tank trucks in local areas supported by Internet of things (IoT) technologies. An intelligent Industrial Internet terminal is designed to sense data of central gas stations and tank trucks, and the collected data is then transmitted to the IoT cloud platform for storage and analysis. A mathematical model of the LNG distribution problem is established, and genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the LNG distribution schedule based on the gas consumption status traced by the IoT platform.

Among many, one significant reason for this achievement of IoT is the nowadays availability of cloud computing which can cost effectively deal with the sheer number of globally distributed devices and data generated from those devices. In this paper, we address the issue of IoT scalability in cloud environments by proposing the unique integration scheme between pub/sub systems and Named Data Networking (NDN). While the pub/sub architecture has been applied in modern IoT cloud platforms, its implementation and deployment practice have not been fully studied for large scale IoT applications. Our approach concentrates on how to leverage the essential scalability of NDN for building pub/sub systems, thereby achieving scalable IoT cloud services.","2330-2186","978-1-5090-1445-3","10.1109/CloudCom.2016.0085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830726","Named Data Networking;Pub/Sub Systems;Internet of Things","","","9","","12","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the promising technologies to support such applications is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT can provide a platform for linking an IoT with Cloud Computing (CC). Another technology that can be utilized for enhancing IoT applications is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable better support for operating enhanced services closer to the physical environment.

Simultaneously, container virtualization achieved a breakthrough by the well known Docker environment that became a key competitor to the utilization of virtual machines. Nevertheless, spreading containers at small scale needs a proper allocation of resources available on SBCs.,, As a first step, we developed a multi-architecture framework ""PyMon"" to monitor different computing architectures with a small footprint. PyMon itself is based on the recent version of ""monit"" and a ""Django"" application to collect monitoring data.

These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications.

As a typical application scenario of a large-scale network system, a smart city needs to integrate a large number of sub-systems, such as cloud computing, big data analysis, and internet of things to achieve urban intelligence. In order to make these separated parts work together in a coordinated manner, it needs not only to manage large-scale complex infrastructure resources but also to meet the demand of all kinds of services, especially the reliability guarantee service. Traditional computer systems improve system reliability by adding redundant devices, but this method is not suitable for large-scale network systems.

In such large-scale and dynamic systems, the fundamental issue is whether one entity can securely communicate with another and if so, then to what extent. In the IoT, entities must interact with one another often in unknown and uncertain circumstances. Therefore, in such systems, it is important to include mechanisms that can help in such interactions by overcoming this uncertainty. We argue that the notion of trust can assist in addressing such issues. Trust mechanisms allow entities to decide whether or not to interact with other entities. However, the concept of trust is used with different meanings and in various contexts. Research into the metrics and methods for establishing trust in dynamic IoT systems is still in its early stages. Implementing trust in an IoT system is challenging due to the nature of the IoT systems themselves. In this paper, we propose a trust management framework that can improve access control mechanisms easing the decision making process under uncertainty. We introduce a well-defined trust model for IoT supporting attribute-based identity without the need for unique concrete identification of an entity. Finally, we develop a theoretical foundation for a trust model that can support our decision making work on access control in large-scale IoT systems.","2156-8073","978-1-7281-4807-6","10.1109/ICST46873.2019.9047734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9047734","","Internet of Things;Trust management;Uncertainty;Authorization;Context modeling","","6","","17","IEEE","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is difficult to guarantee that there is no security hole in the IoT operating system which is usually designed for MCU and has no kernel mode. An alternative solution is to identify the security issues in the first time when the system is hijacked and suspend the suspicious task before it causes irreparable damage. This paper proposes KLRA (A Kernel Level Resource Auditing Tool) for IoT Operating System Security This tool collects the resource-sensitive events in the kernel and audit the the resource consumption pattern of the system at the same time. KLRA can take fine-grained events measure with low cost and report the relevant security warning in the first time when the behavior of the system is abnormal compared with daily operations for the real responsibility of this device.

Communication networks are changing: they are becoming more and more ""software-based."" The use of network function virtualization (NFV) to run network services in software enables software-defined networks (SDNs) to create a largely software-based network. To truly achieve the vision of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible, lower- cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is needed.Our high-performance NFV platform, OpenNetVM, enables high bandwidth network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers. OpenNetVM exploits Intel's DPDK libraries to minimize the overhead of packet processing, and to provide high throughput, low latency networking in virtualized environments. OpenNetVM allows true zero-copy delivery of data to VMs, both for packet processing and high-speed inter-VM communication through shared huge pages within a trust boundary. We envision a dynamic and flexible network that can support a smarter data plane than just simple switches that forward packets. We build on our OpenNetVM NFV platform by developing our SDNFV network architecture that supports complex stateful routing of flows where processing by network functions (NFs) can dynamically modify the path taken by flows, without unduly burdening the centralized SDN controller. The tutorial will also briefly touch upon the problem of dynamic placement of network functions and routing of flows through a software based network, exploiting a mixture of centralized SDN control and NFV capabilities in the network. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and heuristics can be used to solve the problem incrementally.As a case study, we examine the growing communication needs of 'Internet-of-Things' (IoT). With 'smart' sensing devices becoming ubiquitous, there is a need to support IoT communication at large scale, especially over cellular networks. The use of NFV platforms for the Evolved Packet Core, we see opportunities for supporting IoT communications at large scale in 5G cellular networks. We describe potential solutions in this direction.","1063-6927","978-1-5090-1483-5","10.1109/ICDCS.2016.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536501","","Computer science;Internet of things;Communication networks;Software;Routing;Conferences","","2","","","IEEE","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often cloud services will handle these data from a huge number of devices, and hence need to be extremely scalable to support conceivable large-scale IoT applications. To this end, we present a system architecture for IoT cloud services based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is primarily designed for systems of tiny, low-cost, resource-constrained IoT devices.

Traditional centralized approaches (e.g. data warehousing) are not feasible for these applications due to their unique characteristics such as large volume of data and sovereignty of the participants. In this paper, we describe an approach that enables applications to share traceability data across independent enterprises in a pure peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. Data are stored in local repositories of participants and indexed in the network based on structured P2P overlays. In particular, we present a generic approach for efficiently indexing and locating individual objects in large, distributed traceable networks, most notably, in the emerging environment of the internet of things.

Finally, the insertion and query performance of the proposed HSFRH-IoT framework is tested in detail, and the results shows that it has better performance than other RDBMS based solutions.","","978-1-5386-2165-3","10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8393258","Internet of Things;massive heterogeneous data;storage and query;idea of plug-in;NoSQL","Databases;File systems;Temperature sensors;Internet of Things;Meteorology;Memory","","6","","20","IEEE","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a refocus is not only needed to prepare for the time when technology scaling comes to an end, but is a necessity to manage complexity when networked IT systems not only by far outnumber humans but when their complexity by far exceeds that of human societies. While such applications complexity growth is visible to large parts of the society, and is publicly discussed, it is important to note that the complexity growth equally affects the platforms (computers, communication, storage, etc.) which enable such growing applications. This challenge is partly addressed by the new areas of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet-of-Things, but the changing challenges to the operation of complex microelectronic systems is mostly left to computer and software architects, and to semiconductor technology.

Prior to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), the data producers and consumers were large enterprises. Apart from the large enterprises - if we could observe the banking & transportation sectors, one would notice that banks processed data referring to the millions of transactions everyday - Transportation companies like FedEx were surrounded by omnipresent data points - around every package they delivered. All of the above mentioned data needed to be stored in a secure environment. Today, data storage is rooting its base beyond the conventional enterprises - into the IoT framework - dealing with newer landscapes for upcoming industries (e.g. smart homes) and IoT devices (e.g. smart-watch). With all the data being exchanged between plethora of devices, storing and remembering the secret & sensitive data (i.e. passwords, keys) is posing a serious challenge. With the advent of IoT, number of devices possessed by an individual has close to doubled - owing to the increase in sensitive secret data.

The proposed solution is validated by means of a small-scale prototype, and extensively evaluated through emulation in large scale deployment in comparison to a centralized Cloud-based approach. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach guarantees lower latencies than a centralized solution and can ensure scalability for small to medium sized deployments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2767381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086146","Access;constrained application protocol (CoAP);discovery;Fog computing;Internet of Things (IoT) gateway;resource directory (RD)","Logic gates;Protocols;Standards;Servers;Internet of Things;Computer architecture;Cloud computing","","48","","35","IEEE","27 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given this large scale and geo-distributed nature of such IoT systems, fog computing has been considered as an affordable and sustainable computing paradigm to enable smart city IoT services. However, it is still a major challenge for developers to program their services to leverage benefits of fog computing. Developers have to figure out many details, such as how to dynamically configure and manage data processing tasks over cloud and edges and how to optimize task allocation for minimal latency and bandwidth consumption. In addition, most of the existing fog computing frameworks either lack service programming models or define a programming model only based on their own private data model and interfaces; therefore, as a smart city platform, they are quite limited in terms of openness and interoperability. To tackle these problems, we propose a standard-based approach to design and implement a new fog computing-based framework, namely FogFlow, for IoT smart city platforms. FogFlow’s programming model allows IoT service developers to program elastic IoT services easily over cloud and edges. Moreover, it supports standard interfaces to share and reuse contextual data across services. To showcase how smart city use cases can be realized with FogFlow, we describe three use cases and implement an example application for anomaly detection of energy consumption in smart cities. We also analyze FogFlow’s performance based on microbenchmarking results for message propagation latency, throughput, and scalability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2747214","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:723076); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:643943); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022859","Edge computing;Internet of Things (IoT);parallel programming","Programming;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Logic gates;Data models","","164","","15","OAPA","30 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to achieve scalability, distributed cloud technology is used for designing and implementing large-scale IoT systems. Current work on managing data in such systems has mostly focused on persistent data, i.e., data that is stored even after the system has finished its execution. However, very little work has focused on how to manage the transient (non-persistent) data that is streamed through the system and which does not outlive the system execution. This transient data is crucial since it is typically processed to generate summarized insights during system execution, and some of it may need to be stored after system execution as per users needs. Currently this data is either purged after analysis or is fully stored for historical purposes. To that end, in this position paper, we present our thoughts on managing transient data in IoT systems. By managing, we mean the process of generating useful value from this data for users. We therefore provide a precise definition of how data can be characterized as transient. We then use this definition to suggest approaches for facilitating placement and processing of this data closer to related data and/or sources of computation for improving execution efficiency. We also show how these approaches can be made dynamic, so as to accommodate users' changing needs in real-time.","2155-2509","978-1-5386-1182-1","10.1109/COMSNETS.2018.8328274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328274","","Transient analysis;Cloud computing;Sensors;Servers;Data models;Internet of Things;Estimation","","4","","10","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, there is a need to investigate Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based application design concepts within social VRLEs to offer scalable, cost-efficient services that adapt to dynamic cloud/fog system conditions. In this paper, we investigate the cost-performance trade-offs for an IoT-based application that integrates large-scale sensor data from Social VRLEs and coordinates the real-time data processing and visualization across cloud/fog platforms. To facilitate dynamic performance adaptation of the IoT-based application with increased user scale, we present a set of cost-aware adaptive control rules. The implementation of the rules is based on an analytical queuing model that determines the performance states of the IoT-based application, given the current workload and the allocated cloud/fog resources. Using the IoT-based application in an exemplar VRLE use case, we evaluate the cost-performance trade-offs with three system architectures i.e., cloud-only, edge-only and edge-cloud architectures. Experiment results illustrate the best/worst practices in the cost-performance trade-offs for a range of simulated IoT scenarios involving monitoring user emotional data collected by using brain sensors. Our results also detail the impact of the system architecture selection, and the benefits in enabling feedback about student emotions to instructors during Social VR learning sessions. Lastly, we show the benefits of integrating our model-based feedback control in maximizing IoT-based application performance while keeping the associated costs at a minimum level.","","978-1-7281-3236-5","10.1109/ICFC.2019.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821977","IoT-based-Application,-Cloud/Fog-System-Architecture,-Model-based-Resource-Management,-IoT-Data-Processing/-Visualization,-Social-Virtual-Reality","Cloud computing;Data visualization;Quality of experience;Systems architecture;Real-time systems;Electroencephalography;Quality of service","","5","","18","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The flexibility in BSSs comes with challenges relating to unpredictable and dynamic demand and asymmetric usage, which frequently lead a BSS to an imbalanced system and make bike distribution a difficult task. Integration of bike sharing into multimodal journey planning will bring new challenges to the next generation BSSs because of its reservation requirement, which may limit the flexibility of a BSS. Next generation smart bikes with sensing, computing and communication capabilities can be a part of an Internet of Things (IoT). IoT-integrated BSSs will provide operators real-time and non-real-time information about user demands, bikes and environments to improve their services and offer new ones. The IoT's characteristics, including a large-scale network of things (bikes), devices and network level heterogeneity, and dynamic mobility of bikes, will make the collection of real-time information and the development of various BSS-related services including a bike distribution service (BDS), a very challenging task. In general, a framework with appropriate middleware features can ease the information collection and development process by integrating heterogeneous computing and communications devices. In this article, we outline a set of services that would enhance next generation BSSs, and present a framework for a next-generation IoT-integrated BSS to offer those services exploiting real-time as well as non-real-time information. In addition, a hybrid BDS (HBDS) using the real-time information on bikes, demands (bike and parking) and other events (e.g., city events, weather) provided by the framework is presented.

This structure of IoT has now given a new recognition to Wireless Sensor etworks (WS ) such that WS can be identified as the datacollecting component of the IoT. Efficient data collection from a large scale WS , with limited power supply, bandwidth and packet sizes, is a critical issue. One of the methods of data collection in a WS is through forming multiple clusters of the sensor nodes with one cluster head (CH) in each cluster. The objective of this work is to develop an energy efficient data collection environment for a large scale, randomly deployed cluster based wireless sensor networks by using a virtual grid based mechanism to localize the clusters and stabilize the cluster sizes in the network.

In this paper, we design a sharding protocol called MDIoTSP. The protocol first partitions the overall blockchains into many small shards, each of which generally recognized as a micro-blockchain according to the multiple domains, and then make the final consensus by merging the hash digests of the sub-blocks which generated from the shards for the multi-domain IoT blockchains ecosystem specifically. We also develop MicrothingsChains to run MDIoTSP in multi-domain IoT blockchains to prove our assumption that MDIoTSP scales up the transaction consensus throughput near linearly with the number of shards.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761147","","Blockchain;Protocols;Throughput;Hospitals;Smart devices;Internet of Things;Peer-to-peer computing","","29","","20","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a better rice productivity, this paper presents the implementation system of drone based on Internet of Things (IoT) architecture using real-time information including data acquisition and data analysis using image processing technique to perform rice disease detection and classification.

In such context, the end-user is capable of simply creating, mashing-up, and presenting the multiple Things to gain high-level information. However, current research approaches much more pay attention to describe a single Thing. The modeling and building the application for the compound objects consisting of groups of Things namely ""Asset"" are still limited due to the lack of description and seamless integration mechanism. Moreover, the traditional IoT Device Description Language directly installed on device is highly restricted in Massive IoT scenario because of stringent requirements for power consumption and operation cost. In this paper, we introduce the WoT based Asset Description (WoT-AD), a descriptive language for the Asset aiming to mitigate such limitations. WoT-AD explicitly describes a group of Things as homogeneous object to enable mash-up, self-discovery, and simply access their resources, entities, and services. We also provide a lightweight framework that fully integrates with WoT-AD to enable WoT for Massive IoT scenario. Such integration not only effectively models the Asset but also simplifies the development of mash-up application to different-skilled users.

However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers' interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management.

Until recently, data was gathered for well-defined objectives such as auditing, forensics, reporting and line-of-business operations; now, exploratory and predictive analysis is becoming ubiquitous, and the default increasingly is to capture and store any and all data, in anticipation of potential future strategic value. These differences in data heterogeneity, scale and usage are leading to a new generation of data management and analytic systems, where the emphasis is on supporting a wide range of very large datasets that are stored uniformly and analyzed seamlessly using whatever techniques are most appropriate, including traditional tools like SQL and BI and newer tools, e.g., for machine learning and stream analytics. These new systems are necessarily based on scale-out architectures for both storage and computation. Hadoop has become a key building block in the new generation of scale-out systems. On the storage side, HDFS has provided a cost-effective and scalable substrate for storing large heterogeneous datasets. However, as key customer and systems touch points are instrumented to log data, and Internet of Things applications become common, data in the enterprise is growing at a staggering pace, and the need to leverage different storage tiers (ranging from tape to main memory) is posing new challenges, leading to caching technologies, such as Spark. On the analytics side, the emergence of resource managers such as YARN has opened the door for analytics tools to bypass the MapReduce layer and directly exploit shared system resources while computing close to data copies. This trend is especially significant for iterative computations such as graph analytics and machine learning, for which MapReduce is widely recognized to be a poor fit. I will examine these trends, and ground the talk by discussing the Microsoft Big Data stack.","","978-1-4673-8488-9","10.1109/HiPC.2015.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397604","","Cloud computing;Magnetic heads;Big data;Information services;Market research;Database systems;Data mining","","","","","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Factors e.g. the scale of such systems, the diverse range of devices and communication mediums employed, the dynamic and temporary nature of interactions, and the dynamic characteristics of services and applications in the IoT, mean that it is difficult to ensure that only the authenticated and authorized entities can access the appropriate resources. It is difficult to predict, in advance, which entities will interact and require access to services and to precisely identify the exact services to which they will seek access. This raises important questions concerning the nature of identity and identity management for the IoT. There exist many approaches to digital identity and digital identity management, however examination of these questions in the context of the IoT is still in its infancy. Fundamentally, the formal model of IoT identity covering all its aspects is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a survey on identity for the IoT. We outline the foundations for building a formal model of IoT identity based on attributes. We also use the model to demonstrate its feasibility using different use-case scenarios.

However GPS is not useful for indoor positioning as it is often unreliable and/or unavailable in indoor environments. In this paper we present a multi-source radio frequency (RF) based framework for automatic indoor positioning using received signal strength (RSS) and demonstrate its efficacy by simultaneously using broadcast FM radio & GSM signals for position estimation. Our framework is data driven and can be justified using Bayesian minimum risk analysis and is easy to extend by incorporating other sources of RF signals (like WiFi signals) and thus provides a generalized framework for building indoor positioning systems using signals of opportunity. We call our framework RF-MSiP: Radio Frequency Multi-Source Indoor Positioning Using our algorithms with the well known AMBILOC dataset, we can localize exactly for approximately 98.7% of the test locations over a period of one year, which demonstrates not only the efficacy of the algorithms but also its resiliency to change in the RF environment across the year, thus establishing the transfer learning capability of our system.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006085","IoT;Sensors;Indoor;Positioning;Bayesian Inference;Received Signal Strength;Transfer Learning;Multi-Source.","Buildings;Frequency modulation;GSM;Wireless fidelity;Radio frequency;Global Positioning System;Estimation","","3","","36","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correspondingly, on a service level, quality aspects are referred to as Quality of Service (QoS) and are usually expressed by using Service Level Agreements that are unrelated to the quality information on a resource level. On a process level, quality aspects are currently much less considered, as IoT-aware business processes are still to emerge at a large scale.

The minimization of the output average bitrate is an effective way to maximize the system energy efficiency. Level-crossing-sampling (LC) ADCs are a class of converters that addresses such problem. In their conventional implementation, however, they are mainly impaired by analog blocks (i.e. the high-performance comparators), difficult to be designed in deep nanoscale CMOS. This paper describes a highly-digital frequency-domain implementation of a LC ADC, which replaces the analog comparators with an oscillator-based quantizer and simple digital logic. LC is performed in the digital frequency-domain, where the application of adaptive-resolution algorithms to further enhance power efficiency becomes straightforward. Behavioral modeling simulations demonstrate the appropriateness of the proposed topology by comparing it with the conventional designs and by evaluating the impact of the oscillator-based-quantizer nonidealities on the ADC performance.","","978-1-5386-0915-6","10.1109/EBCCSP.2017.8022825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022825","analog-to-digital converter;level-crossing-sampling;adaptive-resolution;VCO-based quantizer;frequency domain","Frequency-domain analysis;Quantization (signal);Radiation detectors;Signal resolution;CMOS technology;Topology;Semiconductor device modeling","","1","","15","IEEE","31 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The smart physical data sources contribute to developing the level of safety and security of citizens' daily life through different smart solutions such as optimization for autonomous power grids and human health applications. Those physical devices generate a massive amount of data that is necessary for analytic applications to be applied in user services. Cloud computing technologies utilize as a centralized ICT architecture to collect the massive amount of data from all scale of the city and build the citizens' services by developers. However, several challenges in cybercrime and cybersecurity exist in Cloud computing technologies as well as large scale IoT environments and smart cities. Those challenges are i) the new generation of the attack on an IoT network is to create a problem with the availability of IoT data for the Cloud applications by overwhelming devices with information requests; ii) complex communication and computation resource constraints has a big concern to moving forward to detect attack at the edge of networks. Therefore, heading off the threat of cybercrime in large scale IoT and smart cities calls for a new study on designing cybersecurity models for ICT architecture.

The ultrasonic sensor module HC-SR04 is a popular and cheap: (<; $2) per unit; it is, mainly, used and designed for distance measurement. In this article, a time space framework for a linear array of a number N of HC-SR04 modules is suggested, for a reliable detection and tracking of lateral moving objects. It is based on averaging of multiple distance measurements and a spatial triggering of these sensors. The experimental results are in-line with the theoretical framework.

Our proposal does not make any assumptions on the capabilities of the devices - it can work with already deployed as well as new types of devices, while also conforming to a service-centric architecture.

One of the most promising directions of evolution is in their interconnection. Already today there is a broad variety of use cases for interconnected embedded systems (automobiles, airplanes, automated production halls, etc.) and the most cutting edge examples demand the distributed embedded systems to tightly couple their operation. As a direct result of this tight coupling, stringent requirements on the underlying communication network immediately arise. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) as a discipline and movement to systematically connect distributed embedded systems on large or even Internet-like scales, promises a new generation of systems and system-of-systems. In order to also enable tight coupling of embedded systems in the IoT, there is a need for deterministic communication channels with predictable and low communication latency and jitter.

In order to accommodate larger network capacity and higher speeds, the 5th generation (5G) mobile communication system is desired instead of 4G network technologies, known as 5G. It is expected to start its initial service in 2020[1]. 3.5 billion Connected things will be use in 2020 in automotive sector due to the Internet of Things (IoT) [2]. In Particular, autonomous driving technologies require high speed for both of computation and transmission with no latency. 5G networks are not a simple upgrade of 4G technologies, it will be needed by adding additional spectrum and thus boosting the capacity with advanced radio technologies. Considering wireless signal propagation characteristics which use in high frequency, the massive multiple-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna and millimeter wave communication technologies will obviously reduce cell coverage [3]. The small cell network is one of the wireless backhaul solution, which is densely deployed by self-organizing, low cost, and low-power small cell base stations (SBSs). 25 to 50 gigabits per second per channel throughput will be used at the data center for 100 to 400 Gigabit Ethernet (100 to 400 GbE) applications. Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), FOWLP, FC-BGA and embedded technologies is expected to meet the requirement of 5G networks from packaging point of view. In printed wiring boards (PWB) applications, transmission loss is one of key factor for high speed transmission, it will cause delayed or attenuated signals. A lot of studies have been presented which related measuring copper surface roughness for high speed applications, indicated that high copper surface roughness is a significant factor in increased conductor losses [5][8][9]. A lot of prepreg material are designed and announced to deliver excellent transmission loss performance which enable high speed signal transmission for high speed applications. The low Dk glass is used instead of E-glass as glass fabric of prepreg materials. Also, specialized resin materials are used which shows low dielectric and low dissipation factor properties. Resin structure with low polarization density exhibits a low dielectric constant [4]. In terms of copper foil in PWB, copper surface roughness will increase conductor loss with the frequency increasing. The signal skin depth is getting smaller than the scale of the copper roughness. Skin effect is that the small skin depth signal must travel along with the surface of the rough conductor, effectively increasing the path length and conductor resistance. From the conductor loss point of view, smoother surface is desired on for copper foil. And thereby new treatment technology for copper foil which enable ultra-low profile by conditioning a copper surface at the nanoscale was introduced. This paper presents the results for the radio-propagation behavior across the nanoscale profile copper foil through measurement of the transmission loss.","","978-1-944543-01-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859528","Copper foil;PWB;Low profile;FIB-SEM;Transmission loss","Propagation losses;Copper;Dielectric losses;Conductors;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness","","","","11","","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By this way, new image analyzing algorithms can be employed in weak real-time conditions, like inline quality analysis in production with time stamps in the order of several tens of seconds. The cloud offers a platform to merge sensor data of all production processes to analyze quality data comprehensively, e.g. for methods like predictive maintenance. Typically, cloud environments are applied for the Internet of things (IoT) or Big Data analysis. But IoT-applications usually generate very small data packages (like sensor values with a size much less than 1 megabyte), while BigData applications deal with very high data volume (terra- or petabyte). Image processing requires an environment, which is optimized for medium size data streaming, composed of images with a size in the lower megabyte range. In this paper, a sensor-to-cloud architecture as a platform for image processing is described. This approach is upward compatible, because it is not necessary to change the sensor hardware, e.g. if algorithms with considerable higher computing complexity are desired (like for a smart camera), so algorithms can be exchanged in the cloud without interrupting the production process.","2378-363X","978-1-5386-0837-1","10.1109/INDIN.2017.8104749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104749","Cloud;Cyber physical Systems;Internet of things;Image processing;M2M","","","5","","6","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increasing presence of the IoT along with its processing capabilities make this environment a common target of IoT malware attacks. In recent years, many malware detection models have come up which use techniques like machine learning and deep learning. IoT malwares can be detected using either a signature-based approach or by using a behavior-based approach. Although, the signature based approach works well in the detection of known threats, it is not very effective in detecting unknown threats. Most signature based approaches require one to have the domain knowledge and the need to use various pre-processing steps before detecting the malwares. This is not suitable for real time malware detection. In this work, we build a model to tackle the malware detection problem in IoT, using the raw byte-sequences which eliminates the need for domain specific knowledge. This allows us to perform real time malware detection with lesser computational requirements. In this paper, we discuss the various challenges in creating a neural network model and propose ways to address these challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed system can classify the IoT binaries as malware or benign with an accuracy of 99.01%.","2159-3450","978-1-7281-1895-6","10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8929496","Malware Detection;Classification;Internet of Things;Machine Learning;Deep learning","Malware;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Neural networks;Real-time systems;Data models","","2","","28","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, the storage technology is strongly required for cloud computing, big data, and so on. The size of data used in business and science is drastically increased. According to the concept of internet of things, many sensor devices are widely spread in the world and generate large amount of data. These data are aggregated to a few large-scale data center. In this way, data center has a model of reality. On the other hand, storage technology is rapidly developing. For example, the capacity of HDD was increased in recent years. SSD and other flash memory based fast devices have been developed and are popular. Such storage device technologies are used to build data centers for big data. In such large scale storage, large amount of disks are used. The cost of storage is determined by the number of disks. It is usually proportional to the number of disks. However, even if the reliability of single disk is high, the reliability of a whole system is decreased because it is reversely proportional to the number of disks. Therefore, it is important to improve the reliability of storage. In order to increase the reliability of storage, several reliable technologies are applied to storage. For example, RAID is familiar with commodity server. In cloud, P2P based replication is used. Generally, the performance of replication is better than RAID. However, the replication drastically decreases the capacity efficiency of storage. In the design of storage, we should not estimate only performance but also must consider the reliability and capacity efficiency. In this talk, I will present important points for designing the effective storage. In my Lab, we have developed Virtual Large Scale Disks (VLSD) toolkit for constructing large scale storage. I will show several evaluations that are measured by VLSD as a storage simulator.","2157-0426","978-1-4673-2331-4","10.1109/NBiS.2012.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354955","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications range from in-home entertainment to large-scale industrial deployments such as controlling assembly lines and monitoring traffic. While IoT devices are in many respects similar to traditional computers, user expectations and deployment scenarios as well as cost and hardware constraints are sufficiently different to create new security challenges as well as new opportunities. This is especially true for large-scale IoT deployments in which a central entity deploys and controls a large number of IoT devices with minimal human interaction. Like traditional computers, IoT devices are subject to attack and compromise. Large IoT deployments consisting of many nearly identical devices are especially attractive targets. At the same time, recovery from root compromise by conventional means becomes costly and slow, even more so if the devices are dispersed over a large geographical area. In the worst case, technicians have to travel to all devices and manually recover them. Data center solutions such as the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) which rely on separate service processors and network connections are not only not supported by existing IoT hardware, but are unlikely to be in the foreseeable future due to the cost constraints of mainstream IoT devices. This paper presents Cider, a system that can recover IoT devices within a short amount of time, even if attackers have taken root control of every device in a large deployment. The recovery requires minimal manual intervention. After the administrator has identified the compromise and produced an updated firmware image, he/she can instruct Cider to force the devices to reset and to install the patched firmware on the devices. We demonstrate the universality and practicality of Cider by implementing it on three popular IoT platforms (HummingBoard Edge, Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 and Nucleo-L476RG) spanning the range from high to low end. Our evaluation shows that the performance overhead of Cider is generally negligible.","2375-1207","978-1-5386-6660-9","10.1109/SP.2019.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835213","Internet-of-Things;IoT;Resilience;Authenticated-Watchdog-Timer","Internet of Things;Hardware;Latches;Sensors;Operating systems;Servers","","29","","100","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides the Wi-Fi connection that widely used in IoT, NDN is challenged by the opportunity to re-architect the latest mobile network, that is Long-Term Evolution (LTE), through named-based communication. LTE could be a solution of limitation on Wi-Fi coverage area. In this paper, the experiment is conducted to compare the performance of NDN architecture over Wi-Fi and LTE, in order to show the possibility of LTE running over NDN. NdnSIM tool has been used to simulate the scenarios on IoT devices. Due to its simulation performed in a small-scale network for the simulation scenario, the result shows that the collection time between Wi-Fi and LTE over NDN, with varied number of producers, is the same. However, LTE has an advantage in further coverage distance that Wi-Fi connection cannot achieved or performed.","","978-1-5090-6284-3","10.1109/CONMEDIA.2017.8266021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8266021","Internet of Things;LTE;Named Data Network;Wi-Fi;Wireless Networks","Media;Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Internet of Things","","","","15","IEEE","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

End devices have certain computation tasks, which can be completed either locally on the end device or remotely on the cloud via computation offloading. Due to mobility and highly dynamic nature of end users, the access is wireless with severe physical limitations on the access network capacity to sustain stringent latency requirements for streaming and real-time applications for large number of end users over wide-spread geographical area. Assuming that access network has cellular architecture and is interference limited, we quantify system performance by the aggregate utility. Optimization of the system computing and communication resources requires accounting for externalities due to interference created by the individual offloading transmissions. While each base station can account for the intracell externalities, exact accounting for the intercell externalities in a large-scale network is not feasible due to prohibitive exchange of the “microscopic” information on the intercell interference by each end user. We propose a “macroscopic” approximation for the intercell externalities, which significantly reduces information exchange, and thus allows for decentralized near-maximization of the aggregate system utility.","","978-1-5386-5979-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406835","Fog/Edge computing;offloading;utility;resource management;externalities;approximation","Interference;Base stations;Conferences;Optimization;Aggregates;Signal to noise ratio;Computer architecture","","3","","8","USGov","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address and understand these challenges, we have developed and employed an intelligence partitioning method which generates different implementation alternatives by distributing processing load across multiple nodes. The task-to-node mapping has exponential complexity which is hard to compute for a large scale system. Regarding this, our method provides recommendation to handle and minimize such complexity for a large system. Experiments on a use-case concludes that the proposed method is able to identify unfavourable architecture solutions in which forward and backword communication paths exists in task-to-node mapping.

This large-scale and dynamic topology is very challenging for IoT deployment and management. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been applied more and more in recent years as a solution for IoT challenges. The SDN concept of decoupling the control plane from the data plane promotes logically centralized visibility of the entire network and enables the applications to innovate through network programmability. At the same time, there are still some open issues, such as scalability in large IoT environments that include several devices. To face scalability challenges, SDN proposes distributed controllers as a solution to decentralize the control plane while maintaining the logically centralized network view. However, SDN-based architecture, that provides the flexibility and scalability, still lacks the smart or intelligent management to self-adapt to possible dynamic network topology changes. To over-come such issues, we propose a framework that answers automatically the business demands and makes the network self-adaptive. The topology deployment decision is made based on information that the controller gives. So for making sure that our proposed framework gives the best results, we have to study first the topology discovery mechanism in a distributed controller. In this paper, we introduce a self-adaptive management framework of SDN controllers for highly dynamic IoT networks. We evaluate performances of the two most popular distributed SDN controllers (i.e. ONOS and ODL) in a realistic scenario where the network topology changes dynamically. Results show the outperforming of ONOS compared to ODL in discovering the highly dynamic IoT network.","2376-6506","978-1-5386-7747-6","10.1109/IWCMC.2019.8766349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8766349","SDN Controller;IoT;Topology;discovery;ONOS;ODL;Large-scale","Topology;Network topology;Control systems;Protocols;Scalability;Connectors;Internet of Things","","4","","18","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By coupling data from empirical measurements on EH profiles with federal communications commission (FCC) regulations on indoor WPT, we propose and numerically evaluate design guidelines for energy-neutral wireless-powered networks, in which a source first extracts energy from its medium and then uses the collected energy to operate wireless devices via WPT. The initial findings reveal that the IoT devices in a 100 m2 office building can be remotely energized by only three EH-enabled wireless power transmitting sources validating the proposed architecture.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2019.2918527","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/P010164/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8721145","Energy harvesting;wireless power transfer;Internet of Things;energy-neutrality;wireless-powered networks","Radio frequency;Internet of Things;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;FCC;Sensors","","10","","15","IEEE","23 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to appropriately plan and dimension the network, as well as the back-end cloud systems and the resulting signaling load, traffic models are employed. These models are designed to accurately capture and predict the properties of IoT traffic in a concise manner. To achieve this, Poisson process approximations, based on the Palm–Khintchine theorem, have often been used in the past. Due to the scale (and the difference in scales in various IoT networks) of the modeled systems, the fidelity of this approximation is crucial, as, in practice, it is very challenging to accurately measure or simulate large-scale IoT deployments. The main goal of this paper is to understand the level of accuracy of the Poisson approximation model. To this end, we first survey both common IoT network properties and network scales as well as traffic types. Second, we explain and discuss the Palm–Khintiche theorem, how it is applied to the problem, and which inaccuracies can occur when using it. Based on this, we derive guidelines as to when a Poisson process can be assumed for aggregated periodic IoT traffic.

In order to realize this vision, a seamless low-latency and ultrareliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication network is required. Thus, it is of importance to characterize the V2V channels in various realistic environments, especially when the line-of-sight between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) is obstructed. In this paper, we characterize obstructed V2V channels in the 5-GHz band through measurement-calibrated ray-tracing (RT) simulations. To begin, the main objects in the real world are divided into two groups: 1) the small-scale structures (e.g., lampposts, traffic signs, etc.) and 2) the large-scale structures (such as buildings and ground). Then, we integrate the radar cross sections of the small-scale structures into our RT simulator through a framework based on high frequency prediction techniques. For the large-scale structures, we calibrate the electromagnetic and scattering parameters of the large-scale structures through V2V channel measurements. After such integration and calibration, extensive RT simulations for V2V channels with Tx and Rx located on vehicles traveling in the opposite or same direction are realized with various antenna deployments in urban and open space environments, with and without sloped terrain. Based on the RT results, we characterize the path loss, shadow fading, and delay spread of the channel for each case, and show agreement with measured results in the literature for all these channel characteristics.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872437","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L161009); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:2018ZX03001031); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771036,61501021,61725101); State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2018ZZ006,RCS2017ZT008); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017JBM077,2017JBM010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473696","Internet of Intelligent Vehicles (IoIV);ray-tracing (RT);shadowing;vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels","Scattering;Shadow mapping;Internet of Things;Antenna measurements;Buildings;Intelligent vehicles","","72","","56","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such trust relationships are user-oriented and subjective phenomenon that hook on specific quality of data. Following this catalyst, we propose a mechanism to evaluate quality of information (QoI) for streaming data from sensor device; then use the QoI evaluation score as an indicator of trust. Concepts and assessment methodology for QoI along with a trust monitoring system are described. We also develop a framework that classifies streaming of data based on semantic context and generate QoI score as a relevant input for a trust monitoring component. This framework enables a dynamic trust management in the context of IoT for both end-users and services that empowers service providers to deliver trustworthy and high quality IoT services. Challenges encountered during implementation and contribution in standardization are discussed.

In India, regrettably, farmers still use conventional techniques of agricultural supervision leading to inputs wastages and near to the ground production due imprecise types and amount of water functional to the field which depends upon soil investigation and plant capitulate. Irrigation processes are as old as humans because agriculture is the most advanced occupation of civilian humanity and need to change irrigation technology. The main target of this paper is to overcome the previously mentioned tribulations by planning a automated water system structure grounded on the idea of IoT and to provide a smart and sustainable solution to a farmer for maintaining their crop health besides yield. We have considered the grain crop that is rice because water is essential for the growth and development of rice plants. Development of the concept of IoT with sensor technology and the solar system is an innovative and future trend in the agriculture filed. Watering large areas of plants is a difficult task and needs an automatic system to reduce human effort. In order to overcome this problem, many irrigation planning methods have been developed based on soil, crop and weather monitoring. Irrigation planning depends on how much water is used during irrigation. The water system control is the way toward altering the capability of Hydrogen (pH), temperature and moisture of the dirt soil. Smart and automated irrigation is a current farming procedure that has been broadly cultivated in created nations to assemble the difficulties of expanding demand of food supply. In this work, we use the concept of a dashboard, it operates via http protocol and by using this concept we can turn on/off water pump of farmland.","2643-8615","978-1-7281-3988-3","10.1109/ISPCC48220.2019.8988390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8988390","Internet of Things (IoT);Automated Irrigation System;Sensor","","","13","","19","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emerging 5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Furthermore, incorporating software-defined network (SDN) architecture into the 5G-VANET enables global information gathering and network control.

This paper investigates the security and privacy issue in the transportation system and the vehicular IoT environment in SDN-enabled 5G-VANET. Due to the decentralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain, a blockchain-based security framework is designed to support the vehicular IoT services, i.e., real-time cloud-based video report and trust management on vehicular messages.

In IoT, for maintaining device to device communication, HTTP protocol has been used for remote monitoring and analysis of data from large number of sensing elements but it consumes more power, have comparatively lesser efficiency of transmission and cannot utilize system bandwidth efficiently as well. Thus the protocols MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), AMQP and CoAP are quite capable of handling wireless sensor traffic under very low bandwidth and constrained network conditions. Security is also another major concern as IoT applications collect private data and allow access to various control functions over the internet. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss a detailed analysis of data & devices security issues and present an enhanced security model with a view to improving the security issues.

By sensing events occurred on roads, vehicles can broadcast messages to inform others about traffic jams or accidents. However, the store-carry-and-forward transmission pattern may cause a large transmission delay, making the implementation of large-scale traffic management difficult. In this paper, we put forward a feasible solution to minimize the response time for traffic management service, by enabling real-time content dissemination based on heterogeneous network access in IoV systems. We first design a crowdsensing-based system model for large-scale IoV systems. Then, a cluster-based optimization framework is investigated to provide timely responses for traffic management. Specifically, we estimate the message transmission delay by stochastic theory, which can provide a guideline for the next-hop relay selection in our delay-sensitive routing scheme.

To address this issue, we develop BRPL, an extension of RPL, providing a practical approach that allows users to smoothly combine any RPL Object Function (OF) with backpressure routing.

However, such platform would need to deal with complicated function module calling relationship (i.e., call graph) of applications and user mobility, and both are not thoroughly considered by existing works of NFV and edge computing. In this paper, based on our previous idea of virtual local-hub (VLH), we propose a complete design of edge computing framework, which applies NFV technology on edge computing environment for IoT applications. To handle the complicated call graphs of IoT applications with better resource utilization, the VLH framework adapts the technologies of container-based virtualization and microservice architecture, which enables remote function module sharing on the edge computing environment. The framework includes the heuristic algorithm for function module allocation with the objective of minimizing total bandwidth consumption. We also present a design of protocols for system operations and mobility handling in the framework. Then we implement the framework on commodity hardware as a testbed. Via simulations under a large-scale environment with practical settings and experiments on the testbed under real-world scenarios, we demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed VLH framework for IoT application service provision.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2948764","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:108-2221-E-002-069-MY3,107-2923-E-002-006-MY3,106-2221-E-002-MY2,105-2221-E-002-144-MY3); National Taiwan University(grant numbers:108L880503,108L891904); Ministry of Economic Affairs(grant numbers:107-EC-17-A-02-S5-007); National Chung-Hsing University(grant numbers:2019-5G-0202); MOXA(grant numbers:108-S-C05); Microsoft Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8880517","Network functions virtualization;edge computing;fog computing;Internet of Things;wearable device;microservices;container-based virtualization","IEEE transactions","","22","","47","IEEE","23 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Importantly, this emerging domain is driven by applications that leverage an IoT infrastructure to provide users with innovative, high-value services. IoT infrastructures range from small scale (e.g., homes and personal health) to large scale (e.g., cities and transportation systems). In this paper, we argue that there is a continuum between orchestrating connected entities in the small and in the large. We propose a unified approach to application development, which covers this spectrum. To do so, we examine the requirements for orchestrating connected entities and address them with domainspecific design concepts. We then show how to map these design concepts into dedicated programming patterns and runtime mechanisms. Our work revolves around domain-specific concepts and notations, integrated into a tool-based design methodology and dedicated to develop IoT applications.

Generally, sensors in automotive subsystems have to work under various stringent conditions (i.e., high ambient temperature). Therefore, to realize wide-range temperature durability, sensor ADC circuits should be fully-digital, including a ring-delay-line (RDL) driven by an input voltage Vin for its power supply, along with an RDL frequency counter, latch and encoder. In the present study, first, an ADC core is implemented with 0.26 mm2 in a low-cost 0.35-μm digital CMOS with a voltage resolution of 10.9 mV/LSB (6.5bit, 40MS/s) in a wide temperature range between -40 and 125°C. Next, using a lower-cost 1.5-μm digital CMOS, a digital-type rotation-rate sensor with TAD has been developed over a wide temperature range between -40 and 150°C. Furthermore, other practical automotive sensors with TAD are introduced. Finally, thanks to the all-digital architecture, TAD is definitely suitable for scaling and porting to another silicon technology with minimal IC design term and cost. As scaling/porting results, using prototype ICs in 0.18/0.65-μm digital CMOS, we have experimentally confirmed their stable operation between -40 and 125°C with smaller/larger areas (0.044/0.29mm2) and higher/lower resolutions [(0.15mV/LSB)/(1.0mV/LSB) at 1MS/s,] respectively.","","978-1-4799-8203-5","10.1109/ICSENS.2015.7370503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370503","","CMOS integrated circuits;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;CMOS technology;Analog-digital conversion","","3","","10","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More importantly, everyday objects will become data generators, with sensors everywhere continuously collecting a large quantity of data about their context and use, processors everywhere analyzing and inferring useful knowledge from the data, and finally communication radios transmitting and exchanging useful knowledge with other objects and to “cloud” based resources. This is the next-generation Internet - rather than data mainly produced by humans and for humans, in the new machine-to-machine-era Internet, data are generated by machines (sensors), communicated without human involvement to other machines (servers or other computer systems) for automated processing to enable automated or human actions, driving speeds and scales unseen by the existing Internet. Distributed video cameras will play important roles in various IoT/M2M applications. To resolve the problems of high data rate, high power consumption, and large deployment cost of large-scale distributed video sensors, perpetual video cameras, where net energy consumption is almost zero, are required. Many technologies and design challenges are introduced for designing such cameras, such as energy harvesting, distributed video coding, distributed video analysis, and the associated VLSI designs. To bring up these issues and challenges, in this tutorial, we will provide (1) an overview of challenges/opportunities in M2M, (2) an introduction of distributed smart cameras in M2M applications, (3) the analysis of power consumption of distributed cameras, (4) an introduction of energy harvesting techniques, (5) distributed video coding and (6) distributed video analysis techniques, where both the state-of-the-art works and possible future research directions will be shown.

Although wireless networks are utilized in various applications and are providing the backbone for the Internet of Things (IoT), it remains fairly difficult to quickly prototype a visualization. The need for an easily accessible simulator is a necessity, sparked by the alarming growth of sensor networks and the IoT. The development of a reliable and robust large-scale wireless system requires that design concepts are visualized in some digital form, before implementation. Simulations provide a cost effective and feasible method of examining the correctness and scalability of the system before deployment. This work presents a lightweight and interactive topology generator as part of a novel web based network simulator. The simulation framework, to the best of our knowledge, is unlike any other, as it renders and generates graphs in the browser. A simple GUI allows the user to generate isotropic and anisotropic topologies of different shapes, and provides tools that help manipulate complex graphs on client browsers and mobile devices.

Fueled by the steady advances in transistor scaling, general purpose CPUs satisfied the performance needs of most applications. While CPUs were becoming ubiquitous, advances in digital storage technologies and sensing devices (cameras, microphones, etc) led to massive and sky-rocketing amounts of data being generated by devices of all scales. Extracting insights out of this Big Data introduces significant opportunities for business intelligence, though the growth of data volumes and complexity of query patterns has been increasing at a startling rate. With Moore's law ending, transistors' shrinking coming to a halt and CPU performance saturating, accelerator technologies are increasingly embraced to augment general purpose CPUs and to address performance concerns. Accelerators diverge from traditional CPU architectures in the way they utilize the available silicon resources. In particular, accelerators maximize the resources available for raw computing (ALUs, Floating Point Units) and push back the burden of correct program semantics and control to higher levels of the stack including the compiler and programming models, while focusing on a selected subset of applications. Accelerators include Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), each with their programming model, advantages and challenges. FPGAs enable the deployment of deep custom pipelines, whereas GPGPUs provide hundreds of small processors executing in a massively parallel fashion. Compared to CPUs, accelerators attain higher performance out of the available transistors for a wide range of applications. This talk covers tradeoffs of accelerators (FPGA and GPGPU) specific to a set of database applications, namely XML filtering, spatiotemporal analytics in the context of the Internet of Things, and relational database querying. Tradeoff metrics include programmability, performance, accuracy and energy consumption. While accelerators achieve high speedups for ""hot"" code paths, the attach point of accelerators in a system significantly impacts the end-to-end application performance. As such, system and deployment-level considerations must be made. To this end, I will go over IBM's efforts to facilitate the inclusion and increase the adoption of accelerators. These include (1) the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI), reducing software refactoring from the CPU side as well as CPU-accelerator latency, (2) the ConTutto research platform for acceleration innovation in the memory subsystem, providing very high bandwidth to accelerators, and (3) NVLink®-enabled IBM POWER® processors.","2375-026X","978-1-5090-6543-1","10.1109/ICDE.2017.238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930135","accelerator;acceleration;hardware;FPGA;GPU;database;ConTutto;CAPI;NVLink","Program processors;Field programmable gate arrays;Integrated circuit modeling;Trademarks;Databases;Programming;Transistors","","2","","","IEEE","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It includes the mobile terminal (IoT side) for data collection and the cloud backend system for storage and analytics. We build our solution upon a typical IoT/fog disaster management scenario and we propose an IoT application based on an evacuation planning algorithm that uses the artificial potential field (APF), which is the core of CLOTHO. APF is conceptualized as an IoT service, and can determine the direction of evacuation automatically according to the gradient direction of the potential field, suitable for rapid evacuation of large population. Based on APF, we propose an evacuation planning algorithm names as APF with relationship attraction (APF-RA). APF-RA guides the evacuees with relationship to move to the same shelter as much as possible, to calm evacuees and realize a more humanitarian evacuation.

With a wide variety of applications, such as home automation, smart grids/cities, and critical infrastructure management, the IoT systems make compelling targets for cyber-attacks. In order to effectively compromise these systems, adversaries employ different advanced persistent threat (APT) methods, with one such sophisticated method, being botnets. By employing a plethora of infected machines (bots), attackers manage to compromise the IoT systems and exploit them.

Given the heterogeneous and large-scale nature of the IoT, security has emerged as a key challenge. This challenge is further exacerbated by the fact that security solutions for the IoT must account for the limited computational capabilities of the IoT's nodes. That makes enhancing the security at the physical layer level an attractive solution for IoT networks. In this paper, a novel anti- jamming mechanism is proposed to enable a fusion center to defend the IoT from a malicious radio jamming attack. The problem is formulated as a Colonel Blotto game in which the fusion center, acting as defender, aims to detect the jamming attack by increasing the number of bits allocated to certain nodes for reporting their measured interference level, while the jammer aims to disturb the network performance and still be undetected. To solve this game, an algorithm based on fictitious play is proposed to reach the equilibrium of the game. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms the mechanism of allocating the available bits in a random manner for two different cases of network architecture.","","978-1-4799-5952-5","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417437","","Jamming;Games;Interference;Security;Sensors;Aggregates;Bandwidth","","37","","16","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters are promising candidates due to their small form factor and low quiescent power, aided by dynamic activity scaling [1-3]. However, they offer a limited number of conversion ratios, making them challenging to use in actual systems since they often require multiple output voltages (to reduce power consumption) and use various input power sources (to maximize flexibility). In addition, maintaining both high efficiency and fast load response is difficult at low output current levels, which is critical for IoT devices as they often target low standby power to preserve battery charge. This paper presents a fully integrated power management system that converts an input voltage within a 0.9-to-4V range to 3 fixed output voltages: 0.6V, 1.2V, and 3.3V. A 7-stage binary-reconfigurable DC-DC converter [1-2] enables the wide input voltage range. Three-way dynamic frequency control maintains converter operation at near-optimum conversion efficiency under widely varying load conditions from 5nW to 500μW. A proposed load-proportional bias scheme helps maintain high efficiency at low output power, fast response time at high output power and retains stability across the entire operating range. Analog drop detectors improve load response time even at low output power, allowing the converter to avoid the need for external sleep/wakeup control signals. Within a range of 1-to-4V input voltage and 20nW-500μW output power, the converter shows >60% conversion efficiency, while maintaining responsiveness to a 100× sudden current increase.","2376-8606","978-1-4673-9467-3","10.1109/ISSCC.2016.7417953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417953","","Voltage control;Detectors;Power generation;DC-DC power converters;Frequency control;Clocks;Feedforward neural networks","","20","1","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the number of IoT devices in vast environments is increasing and a scalable routing protocol has therefore become essential. However, due to associated resource restrictions, only very small functions can be configured using IoT nodes, principally those related to the power supply. One solution for increasing network scalability and prolonging the life of the network is to use the mobile sink (MS). However, determining the optimal set of data gathering points (SDG), optimal path, scheduling the entire network with MS in an energy efficient manner and prolonging the life of the network present huge challenges, particularly in large-scale networks. This paper therefore proposes an energy efficient routing protocol based on artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm, for large scale I-IoT networks under the SDN and cloud architecture. The basic premise is to exploit cloud resources, such as storage and data-center units by using a centralized SDN controller-based AI to calculate: a load-balanced table of clusters, an optimal SDG, and an optimal path for the MS (MSopath). Moreover, the proposed new routing technique will prevent significant energy dissipation by the cluster head and by all nodes in general by scheduling the whole network. Consequently, the SDN controller essentially balances energy consumption by the network during the routing construction process as it considers both the SDG and the movement of the MS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested model by improving the network lifespan up to 54%, volume of data aggregated by the MS up to 93% and reducing the delay of the MSopath by 61% in comparison with other approaches.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2018.2873681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481487","IEEE 802154;hybrid MAC protocol;PAN coordinator;IoT;sleep mode;scheduler table (ST)","Artificial intelligence;Sensors;Routing protocols;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Routing","","32","","38","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, a variety of challenges remain to be addressed, one of them being the efficient resource management in IoT. On one hand, central resource allocation is infeasible for large numbers of entities, due to excessive computational cost as well as immoderate overhead required for information acquisition. On the other hand, the devices connecting to IoT are expected to act smart, making decisions and performing tasks without human intervention. These characteristics render distributed resource management an essential feature of future IoT. Traditionally, game theory is applied to effectively analyze the interactive decision making of agents with conflicting interests. Nevertheless, conventional game models are not adequate to model large-scale systems, since they suffer from many shortcomings including analytical complexity, slow convergence, and excessive overhead due to information acquisition/exchange. In this article, we explore some non-conventional game theoretic models that fit the inherent characteristics of future large-scale IoT systems. Specifically, we discuss evolutionary games, mean field games, minority games, mean field bandit games, and mean field auctions. We provide the basics of each of these game models and discuss the potential IoT-related resource management problems that can be solved by using these models.

However, these devices exhibit significant differences in available execution environments, processing, and storage capabilities. To accommodate this diversity, a structured approach is needed to uniformly and transparently deploy application components onto a large number of heterogeneous devices. This is especially important in the context of current large-scale IoT systems, such as in the smart city domain.

Often, devices communicate measurements and states using proprietary encodings, with the benefit of having all data stored in a central location, e.g., the Cloud. The drawbacks are that all data needs to be collected in advance, even if it is not used afterwards, and that nonstandard protocols make it hard to extend existing networks with new devices. In contrast, the Semantic Web (or Web of Data) represents the successful efforts towards linking and sharing data over the Web. The cornerstones of the Web of Data are RDF as data format and SPARQL as de-facto standard query language. Recent trends show the evolution of the integration of these two efforts into the Web of Things. We propose to elevate embedded devices to first-class citizens of the Web of Things by allowing storage and processing of RDF data. Our framework abstracts from individual deployments to represent them as common data sources in line with the ideas behind the Semantic Web. This includes the execution of SPARQL queries over the data from a pool of embedded devices and/or external data sources. Handling verbose RDF data and executing SPARQL queries in an embedded network pose major challenges to minimize the involved processing and communication cost. We therefore present an in-network query processor aiming to push processing steps onto devices.

In order to protect personal and device-generated information, we propose to use blockchain-based smart contracts for managing patients' information and medical devices. In detail, using blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we create a remote healthcare system including healthcare provider (such as hospital), healthcare professionals (doctors) and patients. Health condition of patients is measured by sensors and such information is written into blockchain automatically. In addition, we propose a processing mechanism to store the medical device information efficiently and sparingly in accordance with health situation of patient. Concretely, we filter the data from sensors before deciding whether to write data into blockchain or not. Doing so we can reduce the size of blockchain as well as save amount of coins for transaction efficiently. However, the abnormal data from sensors will be written to blockchain immediately and trigger an emergency contact to doctor and hospital for on-time treatment.

It is important that such capacity be accompanied by feedback control capabilities sufficient to ensure that the overall systems behave according to their specifications and meet their functional objectives. To achieve this, such systems require new architectures that facilitate the online deployment, composition, interoperability, and scalability of control system components. Most current control systems lack scalability and interoperability because their design is based on a fixed configuration of specific components, with knowledge of their individual characteristics only implicitly passed through the design. This paper addresses the need for flexibility when replacing components or installing new components, which might occur when an existing component is upgraded or when a new application requires a new component, without the need to readjust or redesign the overall system. A semantically enhanced feedback control architecture is introduced for a class of systems, aimed at accommodating new components into a closed-loop control framework by exploiting the semantic inference capabilities of an ontology-based knowledge model. This architecture supports continuous operation of the control system, a crucial property for large-scale systems for which interruptions have negative impact on key performance metrics that may include human comfort and welfare or economy costs.

Therefore, there are MQTT implementations that perform load balancing via cooperation with multiple brokers. However, when subscriptions frequently change for mobile clients, as is the case when handling location-dependent data, or when the number of clients is large, information sharing between brokers increases. In addition, with existing implementations, different kinds of broker cannot cooperate. In this paper, we propose a distributed broker system for large-scale location-based IoT services. The proposed method introduces a topic structure suitable for handling location-dependent data. In addition, distributed brokers and gateways are introduced to reduce broker load and to support heterogeneous brokers in a system.

To achieve sustainable operation, IoT devices obtain energy from both ambient energy sources and power grid, while opportunistically access the licensed spectrum for data transmission. We formulate a stochastic problem to optimize the network utility minus the cost on on-grid energy purchasing. The problem formulation takes into account the different granularity in the changing of harvested energy, power price, and primary user activities. To address the problem, we propose a Lyapunov-based framework to decompose the problem into different time scales, based on which an online two time-scale resource allocation algorithm, is developed which determines the harvested and purchased energy in a large time scale, and the channel allocation and data collection in a small time scale. Furthermore, we analyze the required data buffer and energy buffer to support the proposed algorithm.

Smartphones are one of the most promising platforms for mobile crowdsourcing for its heterogeneous communicating technologies, rich collection of embedded sensors, and relatively high processing and storage power in comparison with wireless sensors. One of the major challenges of mobile crowdsourcing is to guarantee successful transmissions from a large number of smartphones that are affected by dynamic user mobility. Therefore, an efficient scheduling algorithm that incorporates human mobility is needed to successfully collect mobile crowdsourcing data from a large scale of smartphones. In this paper, a mobility prediction-based scheduling framework is proposed to support a large-scale crowdsourcing data collection from smartphones under IEEE 802.11ah which supports the concept of the Internet of Things by providing long-range communication and low energy consumption. The predicted future locations of mobile nodes are used to prioritize mobile nodes and to find mobile nodes that are potentially moving away from the base station during the scheduling process. The performance evaluation under a realistic human mobility model shows that mobility patterns significantly affect the performance of mobile crowdsourcing and the proposed scheduling approach can achieve higher throughput and lower packet loss rate in comparison with other scheduling approaches.","","978-1-7281-0960-2","10.1109/GCWkshps45667.2019.9024440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024440","","Mobile nodes;Crowdsourcing;Scheduling;Smart phones;Sensors;Data collection","","","","17","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, NB-IoT devices still use the traditional access authentication method to perform mutual authentication with the network, which may bring a large amount of signaling and communication overhead. This problem will be magnified in a large-scale device environment in the future 5G network.

Existing stream processing platforms like Apache Storm and S4 are designed for intensive stream processing in a cluster or in the Cloud, but they are unsuitable for large scale IoT systems in which processing tasks are expected to be triggered by actuators on-demand and then be allocated and performed in a Cloud-Edge environment. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented a new system called Geelytics, which can enable on-demand edge analytics over scoped data sources via IoT-friendly interfaces to sensors and actuators. This paper presents its design, implementation, interfaces, and core algorithms. Three example applications have been built to showcase the potential of Geelytics in enabling advanced IoT edge analytics. Our preliminary evaluation results demonstrate that we can reduce the bandwidth cost by 99% in a face detection example, achieve less than 10 milliseconds reacting latency and about 1.5 seconds startup latency in an outlier detection example, and also save 65% duplicated computation cost via sharing intermediate results in a data aggregation example.","","978-1-5090-2622-7","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2016.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7584926","edge computing;stream processing;IoT;edge analytics","Internet of things;Cloud computing;Actuators;Real-time systems;Sensor systems","","23","","25","IEEE","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While leveraging the large-scale IoT-based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoT also incurs more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoT face, access authorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses of today's access control (AC) is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain-enabled decentralized capability-based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of a smart contract for registration, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private blockchain network, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution to IoT systems.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726680","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Decentralized Access Control (DAC);Internet of Things (IoTs)","Blockchain;Authorization;Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Smart devices","","102","1","37","IEEE","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from the downlink case, the central controller in the uplink scenario typically has very limited information about the users. On the other hand, collecting all such information from a large number of users typically incurs a prohibitively high communication overhead. This motivates us to investigate the development of an efficient and low-overhead uplink scheduling algorithm that is suitable for large-scale IoT applications with limited amount of coordination from the central controller. Specifically, we first characterize a capacity outer bound subject to the sampling constraint where only a small subset of users are allowed to use control channels for system state reporting and wireless channel probing. Next, we relax the sampling constraint and propose a joint sampling and transmission algorithm, which utilizes full knowledge of channel state distributions and instantaneous queue lengths to achieve the capacity outer bound. The insights obtained from this capacity-achieving algorithm allow us to develop an efficient and low-overhead scheduling algorithm that can strictly satisfy the sampling constraint with asymptotically diminishing throughput loss. Moreover, the throughput performance of our proposed algorithm is independent of the number of users, a highly desirable property in large-scale IoT systems. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to validate our theoretical results.","","978-3-903176-00-3","10.23919/WIOPT.2018.8362813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362813","","Uplink;Wireless communication;Schedules;Wireless sensor networks;Scheduling algorithms;Scheduling;Fading channels","","3","","26","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyzed the fundamental algorithms in communications systems on IoT devices to enable a microarchitecture design that supports many IoT standards and custom nonstandard communications. Based on this analysis, we propose a custom SIMD execution model coupled with a scalar unit. We introduce several architectural optimizations to this design: streaming registers, variable bit width datapath, dedicated ALUs for critical kernels, and an optimized flexible reduction network. We employ voltage scaling and clock gating to further reduce the power, while more than a 100% time margin has been reserved for reliable operation in the near-threshold region. Together our architectural enhancements lead to a 71× power reduction compared to a classic general purpose SDR SIMD architecture. Our IoT SDR datapath has sub-mW power consumption based on SPICE simulation, and is placed and routed to fit within an area of 0.074mm2 in a 28nm process. We implemented several essential elementary signal processing kernels and combined them to demonstrate two end-to-end upper bound systems, 802.15.4-OQPSK and Bluetooth Low Energy. Our full SDR baseband system consists of a configurable SIMD with a control plane MCU and memory. For comparison, the best commercial wireless transceiver consumes 23.8mW for the entire wireless system (digital/RF/ analog). We show that our digital system power is below 2mW, in other words only 8% of the total system power. The wireless system is dominated by RF/analog power comsumption, thus the price of flexibility that SDR affords is small. We believe this work is unique in demonstrating the value of baseband SDR in the low power IoT domain.","2378-203X","978-1-4673-9211-2","10.1109/HPCA.2016.7446052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446052","","Standards;Kernel;Finite impulse response filters;Baseband;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Synchronization","","28","","38","IEEE","4 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the way to implement more and more components in foil, the Chip-Film Patch (CFP) technology is developed by exploiting the adaptive layout technique. CFP is based on CMOS compatible tools and processes, thus exploiting the advantages and establishments of scaled CMOS technologies. In this paper, a HySiF based on CFP technology is demonstrated through embedding and interconnection of two commercial CMOS chips. Any misalignment of the embedded chips is compensated by a smart lithography step using a laser direct writing tool that allows pattern recognition and layout adjustments by an adaptive layout technique.

However, due to the random deployment of sensor nodes (SNs), physical topology of the WSNs cannot be controlled and typically remains unknown to the IoT cloud server. Therefore, in order to derive the physical topology at the cloud for effective real-time event detection, a cloud-orchestrated physical topology discovery scheme for large-scale IoT systems using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed in this paper. More specifically, the large-scale monitoring area is first split into a number of subregions for UAV-enabled data collection. Within the subregions, parallel Metropolis-Hastings random walk (MHRW) is developed to gather the information of WSN nodes, including their IDs and neighbor tables. The collected information is then forwarded to the cloud through UAVs for the initial generation of logical topology. Thereafter, a network-wide 3-D localization algorithm is further developed based on the discovered logical topology and multidimensional scaling method (Topo-MDS), where the UAVs equipped with global positioning system are served as mobile anchors to locate the SNs. Simulation results indicate that the parallel MHRW improves both the efficiency and accuracy of logical topology discovery. In addition, the Topo-MDS algorithm dramatically improves the 3-D location accuracy, as compared to the existing algorithms in the literature.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2018.2796499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8265619","Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems;parallel Metropolis–Hastings random walk (MHRW);Physical topology discovery;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);wireless sensor networks (WSNs);3-D localization","Topology;Wireless sensor networks;Cloud computing;Three-dimensional displays;Peer-to-peer computing;Network topology;Wireless communication","","39","","24","IEEE","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IoT will profoundly change the established usage patterns of embedded systems, where devices traditionally operate in relative isolation. Internet connectivity brought by the IoT exposes such previously isolated internal device structures to cyber-attacks through the Internet, which opens new attack vectors and vulnerabilities. For example, a malicious user can modify the firmware or operating system by using a remote connection, aiming to deactivate standard defenses against malware. The criticality of applications, for example, in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) further underlines the need to ensure the integrity of the embedded software. One common approach to ensure system integrity is to verify the operating system and application software during the boot process. However, safety-critical IoT devices have constrained boot-up times, and home IoT devices should become available quickly after being turned on. Therefore, the boot-time can affect the usability of a device. This paper analyses performance trade-offs of secure boot for medium-scale embedded systems, such as Beaglebone and Raspberry Pi. We evaluate two secure boot techniques, one is only software-based, and the second is supported by a hardware-based cryptographic storage unit. For the software-based method, we show that secure boot merely increases the overall boot time by 4%.

This work covers in-depth performance comparison of three principal categories of distributed state-of the-art NoSQL datastores by evaluating their applicability and efficiency for large-scale analysis of sensor logs from real-world hydraulic power systems. One central datastore is selected from each of the three principal categories of NoSQL datastores: MongoDB from the document store, Cassandra from the column store and Redis from the distributed main memory key-value store to be included in the performance evaluation. Understanding the differences and behavior of this type of systems are crucial for optimizing application performance. Key insights from this work can serve as a basis for an improved understanding of the applicability of NoSQL datastores in systems for large scale data stream analysis.

Among them, the design of the main node utilizes NB-IoT communication technology, LoRa communication technology, and least recently used algorithm. The design of subnode utilizes LoRa communication technology, sensor technology, and optical-electric conversion technology.

Such networked objects, as well as hosts, and subnetworks are often nomadic or mobile. In addition, there are several other types of events that make network topologies dynamic, including re-homing events, service level agreement changes, reconfiguration events, and node or link failures. We have designed the O2O architecture to handle such topology changes in a timely fashion using native routing and addressing mechanisms that scale to a global network with a very large number of networked objects.

Hence, there is a requirement of effectively making use of huge number of underutilized IoT of the future by allocating additional micro-tasks in parallel which would solve the upcoming needs of the technological trend.","","978-1-7281-4499-3","10.1109/WIECON-ECE48653.2019.9019960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9019960","IoT;Parallel Computing;Multi-Threaded Microcontroller;End-Device Processing;Massive Data Management","Servers;Computational modeling;Internet of Things;Data models;Parallel processing;Market research;Task analysis","","3","","23","IEEE","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most previous work only focuses on the interconnection and interoperability problems among different entities and enterprise application systems in a dynamic interaction environment. However, the problems of how to efficiently disseminate the sensing information among the information providers and consumers on-demand still have not been comprehensively explored. In order to delivery various types of data in IoT on-demand, this paper proposed a role-based distributed publish/subscribe system (RBDS). RBDS is based on a hierarchy routing strategy of Grid. Firstly, the subscribers are mapped to appropriate role broker node by the organization of IoT data. Secondly, divide broker nodes into different groups based on role. In each group, broker nodes are separated into super nodes and common nodes according to their ability. Those super nodes are organized in upper Grid structure to distribute events in different groups. And the common nodes are organized in lower Grid structure to distribute events in the same group. It improves the scalability and decreases latency. At last, calculate the load of each broker node dynamically based on its capacity and its subscribers. Thereby the total number of subscribers on each broker node is efficiently balanced. Experimental results show that the RBDS can improve scalability, decrease latency and balance load effectively.","","978-1-4673-8173-4","10.1109/ICCSNT.2015.7490721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490721","Internet of Things;publish/subscribe;role;distributed system;load balancing","Internet of things;Servers;Topology;Scalability;Network topology;Load management;Load modeling","","","","12","IEEE","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With a huge number of IoT services accessible through clouds, it is very important to model and expose cloud-based IoT services in a scalable manner, promising easy and realtime delivery of smart city services. The existing work in this area does not sufficiently address this design issue due to the adoption of a uniform and flat view to the structure of IoT services and their data in the Cloud. In this paper, we propose a framework for scalable and realtime provisioning of cloud-based IoT services in large-scale applications, such as smart cities. These two features are achieved by structuring the description of IoT services in a hierarchical model and populating them in a tree structure containing references to services and their realtime data. Such a service access structure can be obtained based on logical or contextual scopes of a service. Using this approach, smart city applications can access IoT services and subscribe to their realtime data in an scalable manner at different contextual levels, e.g., from a municipal district to a street.","","978-1-5090-1941-0","10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457098","","Cloud computing;Smart cities;Context;Clouds;Sensors;Context modeling","","21","","27","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The smart city concept aims to address these challenges by exploiting large scale deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies. These technologies generate data that provide quantifiable insights into the state of the infrastructure within a city. Using these insights, cities can more effectively allocate resources, manage services, and enhance the lives of its citizens. The data generated by smart cities is complex and requires high throughput. Advanced data integration platforms must support city-wide data collection, analysis, and storage. These systems must provide features that allow them to scale alongside the growth of the cities to support high rates of data ingestion in large volumes. Additionally, these systems must support low latency response times which is a critical requirement for time sensitive smart city applications. In this paper, we introduce a smart city testbed that will provide a real-world testing environment for applications in areas such as intelligent transportation, pedestrian safety, and autonomous vehicles. The proposed testbed will act as an open platform for researchers and developers to test new sensors, algorithms and more in a live urban environment, allowing them to test before deploying a product or application. In addition to the physical testbed and its capabilities, we will discuss the data integration system and applications responsible for collecting, analyzing, and storing the data generated by the testbed. Lastly, we will introduce an open data platform where researchers can access datasets generated by the testbed.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006382","Big Data;smart city;Iot;Testbed;Software Architecture","Smart cities;Big Data;Intelligent sensors;Computer architecture;Transportation","","13","","8","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an attractive technology to further improve the spectrum efficiency and to boost system capacity. This paper presents a large scale field experimental trial of downlink time division duplex (TDD) Massive MIMO using the developed 5G test bed at the 4.5 GHz band. Specifically, the system performance of multi-user (MU) Massive MIMO with different numbers of sets of user equipment (UEs) and spatial layers is investigated, including the impact of different inter-UE separations and UE deployments, which have not been well investigated compared to the previous studies. The experimental results show that the throughput performance for a wide UE separation linearly increases as the number of layers and UEs increases, while the performance improvement is diminished when inter-UE separation narrows. In addition, the maximum total user throughput of 11.29 Gbps, which corresponds to a spectrum efficiency of 79.82 bps/Hz/cell, was achieved with 24 layers. The results indicate that TDD Massive MIMO using the developed 5G test bed greatly improves the spectrum efficiency for large scale MU-MIMO.","","978-1-5090-5932-4","10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108654","","MIMO;Calibration;Radio frequency;Downlink;5G mobile communication;System performance;Antennas","","13","","12","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous work has shown that, given an extended network with fixed density, multihop routing based approach provides sum rate that scales at most as the square root of network size, where as hierarchical cooperation protocols have the potential to support linear scaling. With limited power, the SNR decreases at least inverse proportional to the network size, and therefore the benefit of hierarchical cooperation will be curbed by the combined effects of path loss and local communication cost.

Large-scale applications using DCNN mainly operate in high-performance server clusters, GPUs or FPGA clusters; it is restricted to extend the applications onto mobile/wearable devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) entities due to high power/energy consumption. Stochastic Computing is a promising method to overcome this shortcoming used in specific hardware-based systems. Many complex arithmetic operations can be implemented with very simple hardware logic in the SC framework, which alleviates the extensive computation complexity. The exploration of network-wise optimization and the revision of network structure with respect to stochastic computing based hardware design have not been discussed in previous work. In this paper, we investigate Deep Stochastic Convolutional Neural Network (DSCNN) for DCNN using stochastic computing. The essential calculation components using SC are designed and evaluated. We propose a joint optimization method to collaborate components guaranteeing a high calculation accuracy in each stage of the network.

This synergy pushes the participation of individuals and organizations to new levels, strengthening democracy. However, the ubiquity of such devices and their unique characteristics of being numerous, constantly connected to the Internet and having constrained processing capabilities turned IoT into the new target of cyberattacks. Lately, we have witnessed an alarming increase in attack events towards IoT. The most common pattern is usually done in two phases. In the first phase, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in as many devices as possible, turning them into their bots. In the second phase, attackers order bots to dispatch as many request as possible towards a chosen target, flooding them with requests, attempting to exhaust device's computing resources: a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is in place. The traditional targets of massive DDoS attacks are eminent organizations, like financial institutions, governments and online retailers. However, there is space still for small scale DDoS attacks towards IoT devices itself. The main objective would be bringing down IoT devices which firmwares are not easily exploitable, such as security/video surveillance devices. In this paper, we present a study on DDoS flooding attack mitigation where IoT devices are the targets. To that end, we propose a feasible architecture leveraging a CoAP Accelerator to effectively improve device's resilience. The CoAP Accelerator works in cooperation with the device's CPU, having a key role on CoAP message processing. The architecture was prototyped in a System-on-Chip (SoC) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and evaluations were carried out demonstrating how device's computing resources are not exhausted, thus allowing it to proper operate while under attack.","","978-1-7281-2949-5","10.1109/IOTSMS48152.2019.8939176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939176","Internet of Things;IoT;FPGA;Programmable Logic;Embedded Systems;CoAP;Security;Resilience","","","7","","15","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We trace the memory access in the hybrid memory and analyze the memory access patterns to separate the read-dominant data from among the read/write data.

In WSNs, sensor nodes transfer the data cooperatively using multiple hops over a network. The large number of hops required for data transmission leads to erroneous distance estimation between node pairs, resulting in a large localization error. In this paper, we utilize a recent development in social networks called small-world characteristics for proposing a novel method of joint localization and data gathering over a WSN. A small-world WSN is developed by introducing data mobile ubiquitous LAN extensions (MULEs) into a conventional WSN. A small-world WSN exhibits low average path length and high average clustering coefficient. Such a small-world WSN when designed with novel routing strategies leads to reduced hop counts in sensor data transmission. Additionally, a method for optimal data MULE allocation is also developed. This method minimizes an objective function, which is a normalized weighted sum of network parameters such as bandwidth requirement and localization error. The optimal data MULE allocation method computes both the optimal number of data MULEs and their placement in the network. On the other hand, the joint localization and data gathering method that utilizes a multidimensional-scaling-based cooperative localization method is also developed for this purpose. Experiments are conducted using simulations and real node deployments over a WSN testbed. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting exhaustive analysis of power consumption, bandwidth required, localization error, data gathering efficiency, and throughput. The obtained experimental results indicate a significant improvement on several evaluation parameters when compared to results obtained on the conventional WSN. The obtained results also illustrate reasonable improvement when compared to results obtained using conventional small-world characteristic introduction and localization methods. The results are motivating enough for the proposed method to be used in large- and medium-scale network applications.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2018.2805921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291528","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs);small world characteristics (SWC);node localization;data MULEs;throughput performance","Wireless sensor networks;Resource management;Bandwidth;Throughput;Global Positioning System;Data communication;Estimation","","21","","57","IEEE","14 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

WSN-RFID convergence is considered especially promising in context-aware systems with indoor positioning capabilities, where data from already deployed WSN and RFID systems can be opportunistically exploited to refine and enhance collected data with position information.

To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, its IDS must operate in a distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the IoT application datasets are private and IoT devices (IoTDs) may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighboring IoTDs to detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require any sharing of datasets among the IoTDs and, thus, it can be implemented in IoT applications that must preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring or financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25% higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate compared to a standalone GAN-based IDS.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014102","","Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Monitoring;Intrusion detection;Internet of Things;Computer architecture","","64","","32","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the exponential growth of IoT devices and the amount of data they produce, communication between ""things"" and cloud will be costly, inefficient, and in some cases infeasible. Fog computing serves as solution for this as it provides computation, storage, and networking resource for IoT, closer to things and users. One of the promising advantages of fog is reducing service delay for end user applications, whereas cloud provides extensive computation and storage capacity with a higher latency. Thus it is necessary to understand the interplay between fog computing and cloud, and to evaluate the effect of fog computing on the IoT service delay and QoS. In this paper we will introduce a general framework for IoT-fog-cloud applications, and propose a delay-minimizing policy for fog-capable devices that aims to reduce the service delay for IoT applications. We then develop an analytical model to evaluate our policy and show how the proposed framework helps to reduce IoT service delay.","","978-1-5386-2017-5","10.1109/IEEE.EDGE.2017.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029252","Fog Computing;Internet of Things;QoS;Cloud Computing;Delay Minimizing","Delays;Cloud computing;Clouds;Edge computing;Servers;Computer architecture;Computational modeling","","177","","13","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, a hierarchical system framework is deployed in order to promote scalability for IoT elements. Moreover, to minimize energy consumption, the proposed scheme takes transmission distances and residual energy of nodes into account for selecting a relevant cluster head.

However, building an IoT-testbed by purchasing these IoT devices in every few months is infeasible considering that most of them will be used only for a small amount of time and will become obsolete with the arrival of an upgraded version of those devices. Instead, a better approach would be rented out the IoT devices in on-demand, just-in-time, and pay for only the time the devices are used basis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose IoTbed - an architecture to deliver a large scale Testbed as a service using the IoT devices located in the users' proximal networks. IoTbed enables testbed providers to build their testbeds in the edge of the network and allows easy and secure access for IoT service providers to run experiments on those testbeds.

This new representation opens up opportunities for evolutionary computing techniques to help IoT applications automatically generate organizational structures according to desired objective functions. Based on this mapping, we introduce the hierarchical GA which enriches standard genetic programming approaches with the hierarchical crossover operator with a repair strategy and the mutation of small perturbation operator.

Blockchain based data integrity schemes can successfully avoid the trust problem of TPAs, however, they have to face the problems of large computational and communication overhead. To address the issues above, we propose a Blockchain and Bilinear mapping based Data Integrity Scheme (BB-DIS) for large-scale IoT data. In our BB-DIS, IoT data is sliced into shards and homomorphic verifiable tags (HVTs) are generated for sampling verification. Data integrity can be achieved according to the characteristics of bilinear mapping in the form of blockchain transactions. Performance analysis of BB-DIS including feasibility, security, dynamicity and complexity is also discussed in detail.

Moreover, in disaster scenarios, the existing communication infrastructure may become completely or partially destroyed, leaving mobile ad-hoc networks the only alternative to provide connectivity. Utilizing these applications raises new challenges such as the need for dynamic, flexible, and distributed gateways which can accommodate new applications and new IoT devices. Network functions virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are emerging paradigms that can help to overcome these challenges. This paper leverages NFV and SDN to propose an architecture for on-the-fly distributed gateway provisioning in large-scale disaster management. In the proposed architecture, the gateway functions are provisioned as virtual network functions that are chained on-the-fly in the IoT domain using SDN. A prototype is built and the performance results are presented.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2867255","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8447195","Disaster management;gateway;Internet of Things (IoT);network functions virtualization (NFV);software defined networking (SDN)","Logic gates;Internet of Things;Robot sensing systems;Protocols;Fires","","40","","31","IEEE","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the presence of dense sensors, low-latency WDA poses a design challenge for high-mobility or mission critical IoT applications. A promising solution is a low-latency multi-access scheme, called over-the-air computing (AirComp), that supports simultaneous transmission such that an access point (AP) can estimate and receive a summation-form function of the distributed sensing data by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. In this work, we propose a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp framework for an IoT network with clustered multi-antenna sensors and an AP with large receive arrays. The framework supports low-complexity and low-latency AirComp of a vector-valued function. The contributions of this work are two-fold. Define the AirComp error as the error in the functional value received at AP due to channel noise. First, under the criterion of minimum error, the optimal receive beamformer at the AP, called decomposed aggregation beamformer (DAB), is shown to have a decomposed architecture: the inner component focuses on channel-dimension reduction and the outer component focuses on joint equalization of the resultant low-dimensional small-scale fading channels. In addition, an algorithm is designed to adjust the ranks of individual components of the DAB for a further performance improvement. Second, to provision DAB with the required channel state information (CSI), a low-latency channel feedback scheme is proposed by intelligently leveraging the AirComp principle to support simultaneous channel feedback by sensors. The proposed framework is shown by simulation to substantially reduce AirComp error compared with the existing design without considering channel structures.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2934956","Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:17209917,17259416); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807380","massive MIMO;over-the-air computing;data aggregation;reduced-dimensional beamformer design;channel-rank selection;effective channel feedback","MIMO communication;Sensors;Array signal processing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Distributed databases;Atmospheric modeling","","53","","39","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a novel watermarking algorithm is proposed for dynamic authentication of IoT signals to detect cyber-attacks. The proposed watermarking algorithm, based on a deep learning long short-term memory structure, enables the IoT devices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT gateway, which collects signals from the IoTDs, to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT scenarios, since the gateway cannot authenticate all of the IoTDs simultaneously due to computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve the gateway's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived, and the uniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive IoT system, due to the large set of available actions for the gateway, the MSNE is shown to be analytically challenging to derive, and thus, a learning algorithm that converges to the MSNE is proposed. Moreover, in order to handle incomplete information scenarios, in which the gateway cannot access the state of the unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the gateway to decide on which IoTDs to authenticate. Simulation results show that with an attack detection delay of under 1 s, the messages can be transmitted from IoTDs with an almost 100% reliability. The results also show that by optimally predicting the set of vulnerable IoTDs, the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm reduces the number of compromised IoTDs by up to 30%, compared to an equal probability baseline.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2878025","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OAC-1541105,CNS-1446621,CNS-CNS-1524634); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509635","Authentication;security;massive Internet of Things systems;deep learning;game theory","Logic gates;Watermarking;Authentication;Heuristic algorithms;Feature extraction","","98","","41","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a newly fashioned RTLS using active RFID for the IoT, i.e., iLocate, which locates objects at high levels of accuracy up to 30 cm with ultralong distance transmission. To achieve fine-grained localization accuracy, iLocate presents the concept of virtual reference tags. To overcome signal multipath, iLocate employs a frequency-hopping technique to schedule RFID communication. To support large-scale RFID networks, iLocate leverages the ZigBee. We implement all hardware using 2.45-GHz RFID chips so that each active tag can communicate with readers that are around 1000 m away in a free space.

Traditional software-defined networking (SDN) based management systems are not suitable to handle the plug and play nature of such systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Aloe, an elastically auto-scalable SDN orchestration framework. Instead of using service grade SDN controller applications, Aloe uses multiple lightweight controller instances to exploit the capabilities of in-network processing infrastructure. The proposed framework ensures the availability and significant reduction in flow-setup delay by deploying instances near the resource constraint IoT devices dynamically. Aloe supports fault-tolerance and can recover from network partitioning by employing self-stabilizing placement of migration capable controller instances. The performance of the proposed system is measured by using an in-house testbed along with a large scale deployment in Amazon web services (AWS) cloud platform. The experimental results from these two testbed show significant improvement in response time for standard IoT based services. This improvement of performance is due to the reduction in flow-setup time. We found that Aloe can improve flow-setup time by around 10%-30% in comparison to one of the state of the art orchestration framework.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737656","Network architecture;Fault-tolerance;Programmable network;software defined network","Internet of Things;Computer architecture;Delays;Containers;Process control;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems","","7","","21","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the differences between optical and wireless subnetworks pose severe obstacle on their interoperability of resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the survivable virtual network embedding (SVNE) in the FiWi access network for the purpose of the robust IoT service provisioning even in the scenario of network component failure. Each type of the IoT service is carried on one virtual network (VN), which is characterized by not only computing the resource and bandwidth resource demands but also the connection availability requirement. A connection availability model is proposed as an indicator of the network survivability and the IoT service robustness. We aim to allocate the resource for each VN with the resource cost minimized. The optimization problem of resource allocation is formulated in the integer linear programming (ILP) model that is solved for the optimal solution in a small-scale network. A heuristic algorithm is further put forward to facilitate the use of the proposed SVNE mechanism in a large-scale network.

Although a number of distributed architectures have been proposed in the literature, both their scalability and their lookup time efficiency remain vulnerable, mainly because of their reliance on flat Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a hierarchical distributed architecture for EPCglobal Discovery Services, called HEDSA, which improves the scalability and the lookup time of the flat P2P architectures, represented by FEDSA. The idea behind the hierarchy concept of HEDSA is that any Electronic Product Code (EPC) can be mapped to one and only one country, which is the issuing country of the corresponding company prefix. An emulation of FEDSA and HEDSA has been implemented on Planetlab using Chord algorithm, the objective being to compare the scalability and the lookup time of the two architectures. Several experiments have shown that HEDSA is much more efficient, both in terms of the number of hops and the lookup time, than FEDSA. Therefore, HEDSA is more suitable for large-scale IoT discovery services applications, such as the EPCglobal Network, provided that the identifiers can be mapped to one and only one geographical location.","","978-1-4799-5952-5","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417836","","Computer architecture;Scalability;Companies;Distributed databases;Routing;Emulation;Protocols","","3","","35","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enable the utilization of such resources in a pay-per-use fashion and to reduce operational costs, in this paper, we provide dynamic up-to-date information about sensing resources at runtime to support applications to deal with dynamic changes of requirements, such as changing communication protocols between IoT devices and cloud systems, launching and activating sensors, or changing cloud services to support sensing data. Our approach is to collect and correlate both static and runtime information from different software stacks of sensing resources in the existence of the diversity, dynamism and large-scale associated with IoT cloud systems. To this end, we develop a framework for collecting, managing and provisioning information of on-demand sensing resources.

Most existing IoT platforms are designed for general IoT needs, and thus cannot handle the specificities of IIoT. With the anticipated big data generation in IIoT, an open source platform capable of minimizing the amount of data being sent from the edge and at the same time, that can effectively monitor and communicate the condition of the large-scale engineering system by doing efficient real-time edge analytics is sorely needed. In this work, an industrial machine condition-monitoring open-source software database, equipped with a dictionary and small enough to fit into the memory of edge data-analytic devices is created. The database-dictionary system will prevent excessive industrial and smart grid machine data from being sent to the cloud since only fault report and requisite recommendations, sourced from the edge dictionary and database will be sent. An open source software (Python SQLite) situated on Linux operating system is used to create the edge database and the dictionary so that inter-platform portability will be achieved and most IIoT machines will be able to use the platform. Statistical analysis at the network edge using well known industrial methods such as kurtosis and skewness reveal significant differences between generated machine signal and reference signal. This database-dictionary approach is a new paradigm since it is different from legacy methods in which databases are situated only in the cloud with huge memory and servers. The open source deployment will also help to satisfy the criteria of Industrial IoT Consortium and the Open Fog Architecture.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258103","Databases;prediction;statistics;Industrial Internet of Things;Time series analysis","Databases;Condition monitoring;Time series analysis;Real-time systems;Vibrations;Big Data;Dictionaries","","28","","32","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, utilizing high efficiency RF NFC comes with a cost-various electromagnetic effects can lead to detuning of the resonant frequency if not properly modeled. In addition, integrating power regulation with high frequency ac-dc conversion can create large ripple voltage supply to a power distribution unit (PDU). This paper investigates the system level issues that arise in efficient, regulated RF NFC systems for milliwatt-scale output power. A method for modeling the various electromagnetic, frequency detuning effects is presented, as well as a selection process for the circuit component values in the design. Furthermore, a reverse power distribution network is designed to integrate the rectifier with a PDU, introducing a target impedance and phase considerations for an RF rectifier.

In this paper, from the severe mutual interference point of view, a mathematical model regarding cumulative interferences in the industrial wireless sensor networks is described. Then, from the perspective of mutual interference avoidance, an adaptive power control scheme is proposed in order to handle the normal communication needs on both the primary link and the secondary link. At last, nonlinear programming is taken to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Some typical analyses are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on optimizing the tradeoff between the system throughput and energy consumption.

Existing stream processing platforms, such as Storm, Spark Streaming, and S4, are well designed to process stream data within a cluster in the Cloud, but they are not suitable for highly distributed IoT systems in which data are naturally geo-distributed and low latency analytics results are expected to be shared across users and applications.

However, given large-scale applications like the Internet of Things (IoT) that need to distinguish between millions of devices, it is an arduous task to identify a particular device that generates its signature using a PUF. Unreliable signatures due to various sources of noise complicate the problem that may lead to misidentification.

In particular, a three-level structure of a wireless system is defined in order to classify the propagation environments, which will bring the complex combination into simplicity. Considering these three levels, there are different tasks like service prediction and pushing, self-organized networking, self-adapting large-scale fading modeling and so on, which can be abstracted into problems like regression, classification, clustering, etc. Since there are many powerful algorithms in the data mining domain to accomplish them, we can expect a data-driven future wireless communication to make our lives and society convenient.","","978-9-2612-4281-7","10.23919/ITU-WT.2017.8246840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8246840","","Wireless communication;Big Data;Data mining;Telecommunications;Reliability;Convergence;Internet","","1","","","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the extensive cost and performance inconsistency of the pure solar panel based solutions further motivate efforts in designing a hybrid energy solution for highway lighting in which Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to play a pivotal role in controlling multiple energy sources to provide an effective environment for such a small-scale application context. This paper proposes an IoT-enabled intra-network solution to organize the energy sources for improving the battery performance in a hybrid energy driven highway lighting system. More specifically, we consider the solar panel and Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT), which utilizes energy from the aerodynamic losses produced by vehicles in the highways, as two main sources for energy generation. This hybrid system allows for generating uninterrupted energy by solar during the day and by VAWT at all day and night times whenever a vehicle passes the lamppost. For maximum effectiveness, a micro-controller is employed in this system to sense the internal requirements for utmost performance. A test-bed prototype is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system over a pure solar based lighting system via a projected cost analysis. The result demonstrates withdrawal of solar dependency followed by a less energy requirement in the hybrid lighting system according to different busyness level of the highway.","","978-1-7281-3024-8","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech.2019.00114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8890258","IoT;Highway Lighting System;Green Energy","Lighting;Road transportation;Batteries;Wind turbines;Solar panels;Renewable energy sources;Hybrid power systems","","20","","38","IEEE","4 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since there are many different types of field devices and since each device is calibrated to its specific installation, when monitoring devices, it is important to be able to transfer not only the device measurement and diagnostics but also characteristics about the device and the process in which it is installed. The current monitoring architecture, however, creates challenges for continuous monitoring and analysis of diagnostic data. In this paper, we present the design of an Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) system for supporting large-scale and continuous device condition monitoring and analysis in process control systems. The system design seamlessly integrates existing infrastructure [e.g., highway addressable remote transducer (HART) and WirelessHART networks, and DeltaV DCS] and newly developed hardware/software components (e.g., one-way data diode and IoT cellular architecture) together for control network data collection and streaming of the collected device diagnostic parameters to a private cloud to perform streaming data analytics designed for fault identification and prediction. A prototype system has been developed and supported by Emerson Automation Solutions and deployed in the field for design validation and long-term performance evaluation.

Indeed, building dynamic, context-oriented applications in small-or large-scale IoT with traditional abstractions is hard: even harder is to achieve opportunistic, QoS-and QoE-driven application task management across available hardware and networking infrastructure. In this insight paper, we analyse by the collective adaptation perspective the key directions of the impelling paradigm shift urged by forthcoming large-scale IoT scenarios. Specifically, we consider how collective abstractions and platforms can synergistically assist in such a transformation, by better capturing and enacting a notion of ""collective service"" as well as the dynamic, opportunistic, and context-driven traits of space-time-situated computations.","","978-1-5386-5175-9","10.1109/FAS-W.2018.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599540","collective adaptive systems;Internet of Things;distributed coordination;macro-programming","Cloud computing;Programming;Internet of Things;Market research;Buildings;Adaptive systems;Computer architecture","","8","","41","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent advancement on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and machine learning enable new solutions and applications, such as smart energy systems and autonomous vehicles. In the past, most of the IoT systems report sensor data to the cloud and perform machine learning. However, this centralized approach causes high communication overheads and delay. In this paper, we present a distributed machine learning framework for IoT in smart cities. It enables machine learning algorithms to be run on heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities, including end devices, edge devices, and the cloud. We first describe a distributed machine learning-assisted framework for network management in IoT for smart cities. We then provide a case study of urban monitoring using vehicular sensor network.

In this third phase of development, the peak-performance of SoCs is not any more in the main concern. Instead of that, we could see an explosion of creative small-size applications: bionic appendages, smartphones with smart sensors, networks of tiny sensors, and a host of other applications we have yet to imagine. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) lists expected performance parameters for CMOS technology up to the year 2028. In this paper, it is shown that starting from the simple RTL architecture parameters, e.g., gate count, and using performance figures taken from ITRS, we are able to figure out the (space-time-energy) performance limits of CMOS implementation of any logic architecture. As a practical example, the study of performance limits of a novel digital receiver suitable to be used in different capillary networks of Internet-of-Things applications is described, here.

The interaction relationships between IoT devices based on various application requirements have not received enough attention in traditional data mining methods. However, IoT devices require a large amount of information to interact in practical applications every moment, which produces a variety of semantic relationship. Different from the traditional methods, this paper employs graph structure to represent the semantic relations of IoT data, which exploits fine-grained semantic information more efficiently. Our contributions are as follows: 1) we propose the IoT data representation framework by converting semantic relations into graph structure, 2) the framework can leverage different meta-paths in the graph to measure the similarity among entities in the IoT from different perspectives, and 3) we conduct a cluster experiment based on regularization improved matrix factorization for different application scenarios that consider the semantic similarity.

The framework involves the system operator, the load serving entities (LSEs), and the end-users with smart home management systems that automatically control adjustable loads. The system operator uses an efficient linear equation solver to quickly calculate the load curtailment needed at each bus to relieve congested lines after a contingency. Given this curtailment request, an LSE calculates a power allowance for each of its end-use customers to maximize the aggregate user utility. This large-scale NP-hard problem is approximated to a convex optimization for efficient computation. A smart home management system determines the appliances allowed to be used in order to maximize the user’s utility within the power allowance given by the LSE. Since the user’s utility depends on the near-future usage of the appliances, the framework provides the Welch-based reactive appliance prediction (WRAP) algorithm to predict the user behavior and maximize utility. The proposed framework is validated using the New England 39-bus test system. The results show that power system components at risk can be quickly alleviated by adjusting a large number of small smart loads. Additionally, WRAP accurately predicts the users’ future behavior, minimizing the impact on the aggregate users’ utility.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2529579","Defense Threat Reduction Agency(grant numbers:HDTRA1-10-1-0085); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1545037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7425266","Smart grid;Internet of things;contingency management;energy management;Smart grid;Internet of things;contingency management;energy management","Home appliances;Contingency management;Smart homes;Prediction algorithms;Internet of things;Smart grids","","45","","21","IEEE","3 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, dynamic processes of the IoT services and system are formulated by generalized queueing network models, based on which quantitative analyses of performance and energy consumption are conducted. The resource management and task scheduling are formulated by Markov Decision Process (MDP), which can balance the tradeoff between energy costs and QoS requirements. To attack the challenge of MDP search space explosion due to the large scale of IoT systems, Ordinal Optimization (OO) techniques are applied to the MDP algorithms, which are able to significantly narrow the search of MDP by slightly softening the optimization objective to a good enough subset.

According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance.

Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used.

The idea of IoT and smart cities increased the amount of available data and magnified the hardware and software challenges of sensor integration. Every day the number of the sensors that connect to the internet increases, providing still unexplored capabilities, but also posing significant challenges. One of them, which is common to traditional WSNs, is still the power consumption. Especially for monitoring inaccessible locations, the lifetime of a node and of the whole network is crucial. At the same time, in large-scale networks not only the power consumption, but also the cost of each node is important. Prototyping boards such as Arduino, RedBoard, and Raspberry Pi can alleviate the problem by providing low-cost and low-power nodes. This paper evaluates the power consumption of the above three prototyping boards in a WSN application. Experiments were conducted and the power consumption of each board was measured under three scenarios.

This is not only manifested by the large number of connected devices, but also by the high volumes of traffic that must be accommodated. Cellular networks are indeed a natural candidate for the data tsunami the IoT is expected to generate in conjunction with legacy human-type traffic. However, the random access process for scheduling request represents a major bottleneck to support IoT via LTE cellular networks. Accordingly, this paper develops a mathematical framework to model and study the random access channel (RACH) scalability to accommodate IoT traffic. The developed model is based on stochastic geometry and discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) to account for different access strategies and possible sources of inter-cell and intra-cell interferences. To this end, the developed model is utilized to assess and compare three different access strategies, which incorporate a combination of transmission persistency, back-off, and power ramping. The analysis and the results showcased herewith clearly illustrate the vulnerability of the random access procedure as the IoT intensity grows. Finally, the paper offers insights into effective scenarios for each transmission strategy in terms of IoT intensity and RACH detection thresholds.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7842349","","","","17","","12","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Spectrum Sharing Protocols based on Ultra-Narrowband Communications for Unlicensed Massive IoT","G. Hattab; D. Cabric","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles","2018 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","13 Jan 2019","2018","","","1","10","Ultra-narrowband (UNB) communications is an emerging paradigm that tackles two challenges to realizing massive Internet-of-things (IoT) connectivity over the unlicensed spectrum: the intra-network sharing, i.e., how the spectrum is shared among IoT devices, and the inter-network sharing, i.e., the coexistence of the IoT network with other incumbent networks. Specifically, intra-network sharing is enabled by using extremely narrowband signals to connect a massive number of IoT devices without any prior network synchronization. Further, to enhance robustness to incumbent interference, each IoT packet is sent multiple times, each at a different frequency within a single band. Nevertheless, the interplay between intra-network sharing and inter-technology coexistence at a large scale remains unclear. Thus, in this paper, we develop an analytical framework to model and analyze UNB networks. We use stochastic geometry to derive the probability of successful transmission, identifying the impact of intra- and inter-network interference on the performance. In addition to analyzing the existing single-band access protocols, we present two multiband schemes, where each BS listens to a single band for practical implementation. Different access protocols are further compared in terms of the transmission capacity, i.e., the maximum number of IoT devices a UNB protocol can support in the presence of incumbent networks. Simulation results are provided to validate the derived closed-form expressions. It is shown that the diversity achieved by sending multiple transmissions is beneficial when the interference is dominated by the incumbent network. Further, multiband access, where each packet is sent over a different band, provides an additional diversity gain, enabling the UNB network to support a very large number of IoT devices. The gains, in success probability and transmission capacity, are higher when devices are not restricted to connect to a single base station.","2334-3125","978-1-5386-5191-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2018.8610460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8610460","Internet of Things;LPWA;massive IoT;spectrum sharing;stochastic geometry;success probability;transmission capacity;ultra-narrowband","Time-frequency analysis;Interference;Multiplexing;Access protocols;Bandwidth;Analytical models","","11","","22","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the existing related studies, the adopted centralized approach might be not suitable for a large-scale IoT network with sporadic backscatter communication, while the adopted distributed approach ignored the demand of the access point (AP). In this paper, we consider a large-scale IoT network consisting of the legacy Wi-Fi communication and the backscatter communication, and aim to propose an efficient distributed backscatter medium access control protocol that takes into account of the demand of the AP. In our protocol, when the AP has a demand to collect the information of backscatter devices, it enables backscatter devices to contend for the channel with Wi-Fi devices in a separate manner, where the backscatter devices are only allowed to participate in the contention in a limited time period. We then characterize this constrained contention process and develop a theoretical model to analyze the performance of the proposed protocol. With this model, we can exactly express the per-node throughput of Wi-Fi and backscatter devices. Finally, extensive simulations verify that our model is much accurate, and our protocol can outperform the related protocol in terms of both per-node throughput and system throughput.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2869015","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872452,61872451); Macao FDCT-MOST(grant numbers:001/2015/AMJ); Macao FDCT(grant numbers:0098/2018/A3,0087/2018/A3); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA19080201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456506","Backscatter;demand;Internet of Things (IoT);medium access control (MAC);Wi-Fi","Backscatter;Wireless fidelity;Media Access Protocol;Throughput;Internet of Things;Performance evaluation","","21","","22","IEEE","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Large-scale service interoperations pose significant challenges for compliance checking of those requirements. These include inconsistency of requirements that can be represented in different formats and dynamicity, where a workflow can be modified based on service creation, modification, or termination. These factors directly affect the decision of a service to be part of a workflow. To solve these problems, service workflow specification (SWSpec) has been proposed as a consistent and uniformed representation of requirements, and algorithms based on constrained truth table (CTT) have been developed for automatic compliance checking.

With billions of embedded devices expected to join cellular networks over the next few years, novel applications are emerging and contributing to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The new generation of mobile networks, the Long Term Evolution (LTE), has been designed to provide enhanced capacity for a large number of mobile devices and is expected to be the main enabler of the emergence of the IoT. In this context, there is growing interest in the industry and standardization bodies on understanding the potential impact of the scalability of M2M systems on LTE networks. The highly heterogeneous traffic patterns of most M2M systems, very different from those of smartphones and other mobile devices, and the surge of M2M connected devices over the next few years, present a great challenge for the network. This paper presents the first insights and answers on the scalability of the IoT on LTE networks, determining to what extent mobile networks could be overwhelmed by the large amount of devices attempting to communicate. Based on a detailed analysis with a custom-built, standards-compliant, large-scale LTE simulation testbed, we determine the main potential congestion points and bottlenecks, and determine which types of M2M traffic present a larger challenge. To do so, the simulation testbed implements realistic statistical M2M traffic models derived from fully anonymized real LTE traces of six popular M2M systems from one of the main tier-1 operators in the United States.","","978-1-4799-8461-9","10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158142","","Long Term Evolution;Mobile communication;Scalability;Mobile computing;Smart phones;Surges;Radio access networks","","22","1","33","IEEE","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While IoT devices typically send data to the cloud for processing, this is problematic for bandwidth constrained applications. Fog and edge computing (processing data near where it is gathered, and sending only results to the cloud) has become more popular, as it lowers network overhead and latency. Edge computing often uses devices with low computational capacity, therefore service frameworks and middleware are needed to efficiently compose services. While many frameworks use a top-down perspective, quality of service is an emergent property of the entire system and often requires a bottom up approach. We define services as multi-modal, allowing resource and performance tradeoffs. Different modes can be composed to meet an application's high level goal, which is modeled as a function. We examine a case study for counting vehicle traffic through intersections in Nashville. We apply object detection and tracking to video of the intersection, which must be performed at the edge due to privacy and bandwidth constraints. We explore the hardware and software architectures, and identify the various modes.

As one of the NOMA schemes, we have proposed a grant-free sparse chaos code multiple access (GF-SCCMA) scheme exploiting the principle of chaos communications for mMTC. It realizes both physical layer security and large-capacity transmission. However, in conventional studies, a message-passing algorithm (MPA) was used in the receiver, which required relatively high calculation complexity, and the maximum number of users in GF-SCCMA was limited to approximately 10. Therefore, we propose an application of the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm for user signal detection to realize a large-scale transmission of more than 50 users with low calculation complexity.

Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.","","978-1-7281-4693-5","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946255","Blockchain;Industrial IoT;Hierarchical Storage","Blockchain;Bitcoin;Logic gates;Connectors;Overlay networks","","80","","47","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the day-ahead scheduling stage, the schedule is planned using the lowest operating costs of the system. In the real-time correction stage, the correction strategy employs minimum adjustment of the output of each unit. Moreover, the schedule plan is corrected to smooth out fluctuations in the loads and renewable energy resources (RES) in a timely manner to better absorb green energy.

To distinguish ransomware from a benign application that has similar behavior to ransomware, we carefully selected five dimensional features that were extracted both from actual ransomware's Input and Output (I/O) logs and from a benign program's I/O logs.

The system uses a single-lead heart rate sensor connected to a microcontroller that is plugged to a computer that has an application which is capable of processing pulmonary rates by passing the data to a C# and MATLAB program and plotting waveforms from the derivation of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings (ECG-Derived Respiration or EDR), and forward the information to the Internet to be stored in a database. The collected information can be viewed in a website and accessed by relevant individuals (doctors and patient's relative). The critical value generated from the t-test is 1.701 and 2.048 for the one-tail and two-tail test, respectively. These values lie in the non-critical region indicating that there was no significant difference between the two sample sets. The average percent difference between the EDR rates is 4.1362%.

However, while feed-in on the 400V level is now commonplace, grid state and power quality monitoring still lag far behind because of obvious cost and complexity reasons. In fact, only very few parts of Germanys approx. 1,1 million km long 400V distribution grid are actively monitored today and even basic grid quality parameters such as the voltage level at the end of the line are typically unknown. Reducing the cost per measurement point and the complexity of data analysis is thus of paramount importance for enabling wide-area monitoring of the LV power grid. The authors explore the feasibility of this goal by examining the performance of a nonconventional measurement system. It consists of a network of Internet-of-Things (IOT)-based power quality sensors, connected to a cloud-based big data analysis platform. Specifically, measurement nodes comprise of voltage sensors attached to consumer-grade smartphones and WIFI access points. Sensor data is automatically uploaded to the cloud system with the MQTT protocol. First results from a field trial in a rural area in Germany indicate good data quality and show excellent promise for detailed assessments of the edge of the power grid.","","978-3-8007-4505-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8278765","","","","","","","","1 Feb 2018","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

However, due to the sporadic traffic pattern of the MTC, only a small portion of the massive potential devices are active, making the activity detection a challenging large-scale sparsity-constrained problem. On the other hand, since the low-cost IoT devices are commonly equipped with cheap crystal oscillators, the resulting frequency offsets would intensify the multi-user interference during the activity detection and invalidate existing detection methods that are designed under ideal frequency synchronization. To fill this gap, this paper proposes two methods for activity detection under unknown frequency offsets: a Lasso-based method and a sparsity-constrained method. Both the methods are first-order algorithms, making them suitable for large-scale IoT systems. Furthermore, the sparsity-constrained method can be executed in parallel and is proved to converge to a set of critical points. The simulation results show that both the proposed methods achieve much better detection performance than a two-stage approach that separately performs frequency synchronization and activity detection. Moreover, the proposed sparsity-constrained method is shown to perform better than two competing algorithms exploiting hierarchical sparsity.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2901482","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671488); Major Science and Technology Special Project for “New Generation Communication and Network,” Guangdong Province, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657965","First-order algorithm;frequency offset;Internet-of-Things (IoT);machine-type communication (MTC);massive connectivity;nonsmooth optimization","Wireless communication;Frequency synchronization;Approximation algorithms;Cost function;Crystals;Oscillators","","22","","51","IEEE","5 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a linear-time synchronization protocol in large M2M networks. Specifically, a closed-form of synchronization rate is provided by developing the statistical bounds of the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix. These bounds enable the efficient control of network dynamics, facilitating the timing synchronization in networks. Through a practical study in Metropolis, simulation results confirm our theoretical analysis and provide effective selection of wireless technologies, including Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular systems, with respect to the deployed density of machines.

One way to model this constraint is to assume that, at any time instant, only a single packet can be reliably transmitted over the network to its destination. In order to coordinate access to this limited communication resource, it is common to use some form of medium access control (MAC) scheme. The goal herein is to optimize the MAC to maximize performance. The design of scheduling policies for sensors making arbitrarily distributed random observations is considered. It is shown that the scheduler design can be expressed as a difference-of-convex functions optimization problem, which can be solved using the convex-concave procedure. Furthermore, this approach leads naturally to the application of data-driven approaches, where the design of scheduling policies where the joint probability density of the observations is unknown can be achieved by using an approximate sub-gradient method to solve an empirical risk minimization problem.","2576-2303","978-1-7281-4300-2","10.1109/IEEECONF44664.2019.9048680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9048680","","Bandwidth;Estimation;Internet of Things;Unicast;Optimization;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication","","","","11","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent advancements in communication technology, people and the things are becoming increasingly interconnected. The availability of the Internet makes it possible to connect various devices that can communicate with each other and share data. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows users to connect various sensors and smart devices to collect real-time data from the environment.

Every organization is facing more and more challenges to access a wealth of information and how to get values out of large variety of data. As creation of data is much easier than analyzing it, there is a need for Novel approaches in data mining techniques to deal with huge data.

Therefore, research and development in academia and industry in that field exists already for many years and is ongoing in several directions. Some examples are Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), e.g., using technologies like IEEE 802.11p, and vehicles communicating with backend systems, e.g., using 2/3/4G cellular networks. In opportunistic vehicular networks, vehicles may not only exchange data for the immediate use such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) in the ETSI Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Instead, a more general type of network might be set up, also for application scenarios beyond direct road traffic related aspects. For instance, buses of public transportation systems could collect data from the field or distribute data among several buses. Thus, buses could become an important part of smart cities or Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. Important questions are then, e.g., how much data could be distributed in such a bus-based opportunistic network or how often is it possible to exchange data between buses. Usually, buses in urban public transport systems follow well planned but nevertheless highly dynamic schedules and trajectories. Thus, traffic conditions have a significant and complex influence on bus mobility, causing very characteristic movement properties that are considerably distinct from other road vehicles. Understanding these special characteristics is essential for the design and evaluation of opportunistic vehicular communication networks. For this purpose we inspect two large-scale bus movement traces and describe the available data and metadata. Moreover, we analyze and compare vehicle density, speed, update intervals, and characteristics that are specific to public transport. Especially for large cities, but even for smaller ones if many devices like vehicles, sensors, and various other IoT things are part of such a network, high-performance computing and simulation approaches are necessary to study, analyse, design, use and maintain such a system.","","978-1-4673-7813-0","10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237118","VANET;Vehicular Networking;Opportunistic Networking;Movement Traces;Urban Public Transport;Delay Tolerant Networks","Vehicles;Ad hoc networks;Vehicle dynamics;Roads;Global Positioning System;Sensors","","6","","23","IEEE","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a service-oriented design architecture which is particularly focused on provisioning and processing data-centric IoT services over Fog-Cloud systems. In the proposed architecture, data-centric IoT services are organized in a service integrating tree structure, adhering to the hierarchical fog-based IoT computing models. A service node in the tree is empowered with features for real-time service data notification, local data processing and multi-level IoT data access.

Invoking all available IoT services for evaluation is impractical due to the exponential growth in these services. To assess the current state of the art related to this research question we conduct a quantitative evaluation of QoS prediction approaches, particularly those that use matrix factorisation (MF) for collaborative QoS prediction. These approaches derive from the collaborative filtering model used in recommender systems, which avoids the problems of many other QoS prediction approaches of requiring additional invoking of available IoT components on behalf of the user. We conduct comprehensive experiments based on a real-world large-scale QoS dataset as well as a transformation of this dataset to more closely estimate IoT services, to show the prediction accuracy of these approaches.

One category of devices such as the Low Power Lossy networks (LLNs) consists of numerous small sensors and low power devices as building block elements in IoT. The ROLL working group at Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT) has designed the Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) which is the core of the IoT protocol stack used for communication between these low-power devices. To our knowledge experimentation and evaluation of RPL is very much needed and not much done so far. A few simulation tools exist which enable evaluation of RPL for a realistic deployment scenario. This paper focuses on understanding of the architecture and protocol stack of RPL and thereby its place in IoT. The performance of RPL is carried out for a Smart Health environment scenario by the simulations done in the Contiki OS Cooja simulator with respect to the performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, latency, signalling overhead and energy consumption. The simulation results reveal that the RPL has shown certain suitable characteristics which may make it useful for larger scale deployments.","","978-1-4673-8855-9","10.1109/ICCCI.2017.8117763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117763","Internet of Things;RPL Routing Protocol","Computer architecture;Routing protocols;Sensors;Standards;Internet of Things","","14","","35","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been demonstrated that this redirection can be realized by flexible distributed systems on Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks. In this paper, as the first step, the vision for such systems has been clarified and the technological feasibility has been assessed. The conceptual system has been designed by integrating currently available technologies under the principle of self-responsibility, which allows system construction with minimal investment and low-cost management. The IoT sensor networks allow for response at the stage of pre-symptoms or developed symptoms and lead to an effective response with much lower cost, compared with traditional central hospital based rigid systems. The distributed system would greatly benefit remote areas of advanced countries as well as developmental countries. The unique point of the study is new business creation by activated residents; to enhance positive economic cycles in addition to reducing healthcare and medical cost. A social experiment has been planned for a remote village in the west of Tokyo prefecture to be proposed to the local government and residents.

Mankind is moving fast towards connected future, where not only autonomous vehicles but entire cities infrastructure will be completely internet connected to support rapid urbanization. To reap the full benefit of IoT, it is imperative that the infrastructure we depend upon is adequate to deliver the services envisioned and has the necessary resilience, robustness and security. IoT can be described as an large scale, heterogeneous, ultra-complex Ecosystem acting as bridge between cyber and physical worlds. Recently, the Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain and Block less-different implementation of Data Structures with cryptographic algorithmic functions) has gained much attention in IoT solutions from security perspective. In This Research Paper we have explained the concepts about the functioning of Distributed Ledger Technology with focus on how it can provide security (for System Resiliency) in IoT Ecosystem.","","978-1-5386-9346-9","10.1109/AICAI.2019.8701282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8701282","Internet of Things (IoT);Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT);Blockchain;Resilience;Security;Smart contracts;DAG;IOTA Protocol;Tangle","Blockchain;Distributed ledger;Internet of Things;Security;Ecosystems;Resilience","","8","","11","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While IoT still presuming different definitions, its application had set a broader footprint in almost all walks of our daily life. The voluminous amount of data generated by the millions of IoT devices imposes a higher demand on the computation and storage resources. The compute resources to serve the IoT applications need to be chosen depending upon the heterogeneity of the IoT devices. The various constraints of IoT make resource provisioning in the cloud a non trivial task. Fog computing is the apt platform to deal with such constraints of IoT. The IoT challenges like heterogeneity, scalability and low latency can be addressed by fog computing by adapting intelligence features of machine learning in its resource management techniques. In this paper, we propose a resource management technique for fog computing in which an agent adapts centralized learning and distributed scheduling of IoT tasks.

One could attempt to employ traditional DDoS defense solutions, but these solutions are hardly suitable in IoT environments since they seldom consider the resource constraints of IoT devices. We present FR-WARD, a system that defends against DDoS attacks launched from an IoT network. FR-WARD operates close to potential attack sources at the gateway of an IoT network and drops packets to throttle any DDoS traffic that attempts to leave the IoT network. However, in order to properly react to traffic too difficult to categorically label as good or bad, FR-WARD employs a novel response based on the fast retransmit and flow control mechanisms of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which minimizes the energy consumption and network latency of benign IoT devices within the policed network. Based on our mathematical analysis, simulation, and experimental evaluation, FR-WARD not only effectively mitigates DDoS traffic, but also minimizes the number of retransmitted packets and the connection durations of benign IoT devices. In fact, FR-WARD can successfully mitigate both naive flood attacks and smarter DDoS attacks that follow TCP congestion control but still reduce overhead caused by retransmitted packets for benign IoT devices by a up to a factor of 150.","1095-2055","978-1-5386-5156-8","10.1109/ICCCN.2018.8487342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8487342","","Computer crime;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Protocols;Energy consumption;Mathematical model;Botnet","","2","","28","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for an efficient system operation, a proficient scheduling mechanism is required due to its direct association with performance parameters. Many existing techniques such as time division multiple access (TDMA), do not perform well in industrial environments due to their stringent timeliness requirements. In this paper, we propose a medium access control (MAC) layer protocol for node scheduling in a scenario where some devices may not be in one-hop range of the aggregator and thus renders a multi-hop mechanism inevitable. A discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model is proposed to characterize the transmission of multi-tier nodes and the analytical expressions of throughput and latency are derived. It has been oberved that the delay scales linearly with the number of nodes which are away not in one-hop distance of the aggregator.

Such tasks require investigation, understanding, selection, and implementation of specific ML workflows, which often lead to bottlenecks, production issues, and code management complexity and even then may not have a final desirable outcome. This paper proposes the Machine Learning Framework for IoT data (ML4IoT), which is designed to orchestrate ML workflows, particularly on large volumes of data series. The ML4IoT framework enables the implementation of several types of ML models, each one with a different workflow. These models can be easily configured and used through a simple pipeline.

"Low-Latency and Energy-Balanced Data Transmission Over Cognitive Small World WSN","O. J. Pandey; R. M.

Addressing this problem leads to increased network lifetime and improved network feasibility for real time applications. In WSNs, sensor nodes transfer the data using multihop data transmission model. The large number of hops required for data transmission leads to poor energy balancing and large data latency across the network. In this paper, we utilize a recent development in social networks called small world characteristics for proposing a novel method of low-latency and energy-balanced data transmission over WSN. Small world WSN (SW-WSN) exhibits low average path length and high average clustering coefficient. A cognitive SW-WSN is developed by adding new links between a selected fraction of nodes and the sink. A new data routing method is also proposed by optimizing energy cost of the links. This method yields uniform energy consumption and faster data transfer. Experiments are conducted using simulations and real node deployments over a WSN testbed. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting exhaustive analysis of network lifetime, residual energy, and data latency over the WSN. Experimental results obtained indicate that the proposed cognitive small world model achieves energy balancing, increases network lifetime, improves energy efficiency, and reduces data latency when compared to results obtained using various state-of-the-art approaches.

Today's WSNs normally use dedicated gateways to bridge sensors and IP networks. The installation and maintenance of such a WSN infrastructure are expensive and non-scalable. As the number of smart phone users grows exponentially every year, a powerful mobile computing platform could be used as an alternative WSN infrastructure, which is ubiquitous and scalable. This paper studies the major challenges of using mobile phones as spontaneous gateways of WSNs in IoT systems. The challenges include (1) matching the throughput of mobile phone gateways and sensor data rate at hotspot locations, (2) securing sensor data access and (3) providing accounting records of gateway the service offered by mobile phones. In this paper, we show that using a name-based future Internet architecture (FIA), such as Mobility First, these challenges can be overcome effectively though its native networking layer functions. A proof-of-concept prototype system demonstrates the feasibility of proposed solution. The system delivers a temperature sensor data from an Android phone directly to multiple applications via in-network multicast over an Mobility First network test bed.","","978-0-7695-5046-6","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.89","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682103","M2M communications;wireless sensor networks;Internet of things;future Internet architecture","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Logic gates;Mobile communication;Internet;Mobile handsets;Servers","","22","","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The report discusses two uses of IoT with Blockchain as examples for the industry with many other possibilities being adoptable in a proposed single architecture that would integrate industry procedures to a common platform. While identifying technological improvements to the industry the paper also identifies the practical aspects of such a development, with varying interests across the sector, restricted funds and advancing computing power all being significant factors in whether and how to invest in such technologies. With reference to other industry attempts to make improved decisions from IoT technologies, the necessity for industry representation and leadership is seen as a significant factor in the success of any large-scale industry-wide development of a size where significant industry improvements would be achieved. While small scale isolated projects can assist individual institutions the savings industry-wide from these is likely to be much less significant than a single platform addressing total industry issues, however, the complexity in achieving this is not to be underestimated. A government body or the healthcare industry, is potentially required to coordinate the design and implementation, compiling the scope and design documentation with funding and development/implementation being provided for the industry as a whole. The paper concludes that the technologies can offer considerable technical advantages to healthcare but these are in the early stages of development. The opportunities and requirements for healthcare are significant and need early consideration and industry coordination, using existing network developments as a basis for healthcare platform designs and developed specifically to address the needs of the industry.","","978-1-5386-7001-9","10.1109/ICGS3.2019.8688184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8688184","","","","9","","16","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Targeting dense sensors, low-latency WDA poses a design challenge for high-mobility or mission critical IoT applications. A promising solution is a low- latency multi-access scheme, called over-the-air computing (AirComp), that supports simultaneous transmission such that an access point (AP) can estimate and receive a summation-form function of the distributed data by exploiting the waveform- superposition property of multi-access channels. In this work, we propose a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp framework for an IoT network with clustered multi-antenna sensors and an AP with large receive arrays. The contributions of this work are two-fold. Define the AirComp error as the error in the functional value received at AP due to channel noise. First, under the criterion of minimum error, the optimal receive beamformer at the AP, called decomposed aggregation beamformer (DAB), is shown to have a decomposed architecture: the inner component focuses on channel-dimension reduction and the outer component focuses on joint equalization of the resultant low-dimensional small-scale fading channels. Second, to provision DAB with the required channel state information (CSI), a low-latency channel feedback scheme is proposed by intelligently leveraging the AirComp principle to support simultaneous channel- feedback by sensors.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013501","","MIMO communication;Array signal processing;Sensors;Antenna arrays;Distributed databases;Covariance matrices;Wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"“SELF-HII”: Strength + endurance + longevity through gameplay with humanistic intelligence by Fieldary Human Information Interaction","S. Mann","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India","2014 IEEE Games Media Entertainment","26 Feb 2015","2014","","","1","8","In 1995 Gershon founded the field of HII (Human Information Interaction). I build upon his seminal work by creating a new multiscale framework for (1) sensing, and (2) being sensed by, any measurable or generable classical or quantum scalar, vector, spinor, or tensor field, such as being able to sense and be sensed by water, sound, light (real or virtual) - and in some cases even being able to sense sensing itself (i.e. the sightfield of a camera-visualizing vision and seeing sight itself). I call this FHII (Fieldary Human Information Interaction) and apply it to physical fitness by way of serious games. Physical fitness training normally builds strength or endurance. Strength usually deals with a short-term (short time period), and is somewhat related to power, as measured in Watts (Joules per second). Endurance usually deals with a longer-term, and is more closely related to energy, as measured in Joules (Watt seconds). I argue that the time-scale of endurance is really only medium-term, when considering an average human lifespan. Therefore I present a third category of physical fitness I call Longevity, along with a new quantity I call ""actergy"" (""total action""). Actergy has units of Joule seconds, the same units as Plank's constant, angular momentum, and action. These three units: (1) Joules per second, (2) Joules, and (3) Joule seconds, suggest (1) Differential, (2) Proportional, and (3) Integral, forms of kinesology. Their three related forms of fitness training: Strength + Endurance + Longevity (SEL), can operate within the Fieldary Human Information Interaction space. I present a unified framework for this: SEL-FHII (""O Φ"", pronounced ""sel Φ "", i.e. either ""selfeye"" or ""selfie"") training that combines all three time scales (differential, proportional, and integral) with ideas in HI (Humanistic Intelligence). Combining wearable computing and IoT (Internet of Things), we can contextualize the otherwise disparate fields of/in Serious Games, SELFHII, Sonelization, Entertainment, and Media, across these multiple scales, as a form of urban design, whether at the environmental scale of countries, cities, and streets, or the invironmental scale of Digital Eye Glass and the individual body (e.g. clothing as a building built for a single occupant). In particular, thinking beyond traditional gaming consoles, we can achieve longevity through gameplay at the intersection of cyberspace and the real world.","","978-1-4799-7546-4","10.1109/GEM.2014.7047970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047970","","","","1","","53","IEEE","26 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the planning stage of deploying an IoT system, we are concerned about sensor selection in the IoT system, which allocates predefined IoT services to multiple sensor devices so as to optimize one or more objectives associated with these allocations, under energy and distance constraints. The sensor selection problem that optimizes a utility function in other applications has been shown to be NP-hard, and the number of IoT services concerned is enormous in practice. Hence, it is suitable to apply evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving the large-scale problem with multiple objectives. Recently, the paradigm of multiple-objective EAs (which often address only two or three objectives) has advanced to many-objective EAs (which are intended to address four or more objectives that may be in conflict with each other in many cases). Therefore, this article considers many objectives of the sensor selection problem in the IoT system, including optimization of communication energy consumption, energy balancing on all devices, energy harvesting, green concerns, and QoS. The problem is resolved by a tailored many-objective EA based on decomposition to increase computational efficiency and solution quality.

MI can improve Internet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management of large volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale IoT deployments. When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment must account for the latency demands and network bandwidth requirements. To this extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device aims to address such requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in the IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of MI interoperability. Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the application that exploits it, limiting the provisioning of that specific intelligence service to additional applications. The objective of this article is to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on decoupling the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional device's stack and introducing an intelligence layer that provides services to the overlying application layer. This paradigm aims to provide final users with more control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting providers' incentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device. Based on the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects related to the intelligence distribution and its impact in the whole MI ecosystem.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2019.2937613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870279","","Artificial intelligence;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Machine intelligence","","11","","29","IEEE","16 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Micro-level (household and small commercial) demand-side grid flexibility could be a cost-effective strategy to integrate high penetrations of wind and solar energy, but literature and field deployments exploring the necessary information and communication technologies (ICTs) are scant. This paper presents an exploratory framework for enabling information driven grid flexibility through the Internet of Things (IoT), and a proof-of-concept wireless sensor gateway (FlexBox) to collect the necessary parameters for adequately monitoring and actuating the micro-level demand-side. In the summer of 2015, thirty sensor gateways were deployed in the city of Managua (Nicaragua) to develop a baseline for a near future small-scale demand response pilot implementation. FlexBox field data has begun shedding light on relationships between ambient temperature and load energy consumption, load and building envelope energy efficiency challenges, latency communication network challenges, and opportunities to engage existing demand-side user behavioral patterns. Information driven grid flexibility strategies present great opportunity to develop new technologies, system architectures, and implementation approaches that can easily scale across regions, incomes, and levels of development.","","978-1-4503-4966-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7946881","Internet of Things (IoT);network architecture;wireless sensor networks;energy management;energy reporting;electric grid flexibility","Monitoring;Renewable energy sources;Load management;Refrigerators;Load modeling;Control systems;Real-time systems","","","","47","","15 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enforce access control policies without trusted online entity, one promising approach is to maintain a group key shared between a device and its current subscribers, such that the device can encrypt its data and only the subscribers can decrypt it. However, prior group key management (GKM) schemes fail to efficiently address new challenges introduced by the massive scale of IoT devices, dynamic memberships of users, and changes in the number of devices. This paper explores efficient GKM to accommodate multiple devices (in addition to multiple users) and to handle frequent membership and device number changes. Inspired by the observation that devices with similar functionalities often have similar access permissions, we propose a two-tier GKM architecture called GroupIt, in which each device is assigned to one of many predefined groups, and key management is performed within each group as well as between groups to improve efficiency. Despite being conceptually simple, GroupIt addresses technical challenges including: 1) preventing a malicious device from obtaining extra information about other devices in the same group and 2) ensuring forward/backward secrecy and preventing collusion attacks when gluing two existing GKMs together. The probability of a successful collusion attack quickly drops to 0.3% after five membership changes even in a small device group (e.g., 8). This paper provides both theoretical analysis and a proof-of-concept implementation based on Alljoyn, an opensource IoT communication framework to demonstrate the feasibility of GroupIt.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2840321","Academia Sinica; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 106-3114-E-011-003,107-2636-E-002-005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8364541","Dynamic membership;group key management (GKM);Internet of Things (IoT);multiple devices and owners","Internet of Things;Encryption;Computer architecture;Access control;Performance evaluation;Intelligent sensors","","40","","25","IEEE","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The applications typically use a publish/subscribe architecture. A broker collects data from the IoT devices (or publishers) and relays the data to the relevant subscribers such as monitoring and alerting systems. Unfortunately, the broker does not scale as the number of IoT devices increases, and is a single point of failure. In this work, we present Nucleus, a container architecture that (a) supports scaling to a large number of IoT devices, (b) provides high resiliency to failures, and (c) incurs low overhead in terms of data transfer between the IoT devices and the broker. The key intuition in Nucleus is to design a stateless broker that decouples the networking functionality of the broker from the state information it needs to maintain. The stateless broker relays information from the publishers to the subscribers, and a separate cache manager maintains the state information required. This architecture allows the brokers to be created rapidly upon failure since they are simple. The cache manager is more complex but can be developed independently of the broker. Finally, we implement the networking substrate between the IoT devices and the broker using MQTT, a protocol that is specifically designed for low bandwidth, lightweight communication. We implement Nucleus and evaluate it in terms of scalability, resiliency, and networking overhead.","2155-2509","978-1-5386-1182-1","10.1109/COMSNETS.2018.8328216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328216","Internet-of-Things;resiliency;scalability;mqtt;broker architecture","Containers;Resilience;Intelligent sensors;Reliability;Protocols;Smart cities","","19","","38","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, securing FPGA-based designs against piracy, reverse engineering, and tampering is challenging, especially for systems that require remote upgrade. In many cases, existing solutions based on bit-stream encryption may not provide sufficient protection against these attacks. In this paper, we present a novel obfuscation approach for provably robust protection of FPGA bitstreams at low overhead that goes well beyond the protection offered by bitstream encryption. The approach works with existing FPGA architectures and synthesis flows, and can be used with encryption techniques, or by itself for power and area-constrained systems. It leverages “FPGA dark silicon” - unused resources within the configurable logic blocks - to efficiently obfuscate the true functionality. We provide a detailed threat model and security analysis for the approach. We have developed a complete application mapping framework that integrates with the Altera Quartus II software. Using this CAD framework, we achieve provably strong security against all major attacks on FPGA bitstreams with an average 13% latency and 2% total power overhead for a set of benchmark circuits, as well as several large-scale open-source IP blocks on commercial FPGA.","","978-1-5090-3707-0","10.1109/ReConFig.2016.7857187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857187","","Field programmable gate arrays;Table lookup;Hardware;Silicon;Encryption;Benchmark testing","","31","","18","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, cellular networks support large-scale, quality of service guaranteed, and secured communications. However, tremendous proximal communications via local base stations (BSs) will lead to severe traffic congestion and huge energy consumption in conventional cellular networks. Device-to-device (D2D) communications can potentially offload traffic from and reduce energy consumption of BSs. In order to realize the vision of a truly global IoT, we propose a novel architecture, i.e., overlay-based green relay assisted D2D communications with dual batteries in heterogeneous cellular networks. By optimally allocating the network resource, our proposed resource allocation method provisions the IoT services and minimizes the overall energy consumption of the pico relay BSs.

A unified and common data processing and communication methodology is required so that the IoT, mobile networks, and Cloud-based environments seamlessly integrate, which can be fulfilled by self-organizing mobile agents, discussed in this work. Currently, portability, resource constraints, security, and scalability of Agent Processing Platforms (APP) are essential issues for the deployment of Multi-agent Systems (MAS) in highly heterogeneous networks.

The virtual sensors enable a holistic composition and modelling approach. Self-organizing and adaptive mobile agents are well known as the core cells of holistic and modular systems.

By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong per-slice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled “switch node”, called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices. We describe the design of BLESS, and illustrate its utility through a few practical use cases.","","978-1-5386-2784-6","10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116440","","Switches;Peer-to-peer computing;IP networks;Conferences;Protocols;Medical services","","1","","15","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IoT equips manufacturing systems with sensing, computing and communications capabilities, which enable real-time monitoring and control of increasingly complex and geographically distributed factory floors. However, the increased used of computer networks in IoT-enabled manufacturing introduces cyber-vulnerabilities that can be exploited by sophisticated adversaries to sabotage manufacturing operations. A particularly serious cyberattack against manufacturing systems is the defect injection (DI) attack. In a DI attack, a compromised machine fabricates objects with deformed geometry, weak material composition, abnormal dimensions, etc., which pose a great risk to safety-critical applications. In this paper, we develop a method to identify compromised machines that launch DI attacks against smart manufacturing systems. Specifically, we first propose a DI attack localization (DIAL) algorithm that uses machines' energy consumption and voltage measurements to identify compromised machines in the system. Our proposed approach only requires modest hardware resources and can be used in large-scale systems. We implement our DIAL algorithm on a real-world advanced manufacturing testbed, and observe that it can successfully locate the compromised machines with a high detection rate.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8647631","","Energy consumption;Voltage measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Energy measurement;Manufacturing systems","","1","","19","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the emerging field of smart environments, like Smart Cities and Smart Factories for industry or agriculture, a digital counterpart of a real world site, driven by hundreds of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that emit their data in realtime, is a central part of the application. Maintaining such a large-scale virtual environment and keeping it up-to-date with changing requirements set by connected sensors and services is a challenge. For this, we present FiVES, a server framework that is based on an aspect-oriented architecture to create highly maintainable large-scale virtual environments by avoiding crosscutting concerns like tangling or scattering of code between modules in resulting applications. We present a fully functional implementation of our system that builds on an extendable and versatile data model, a flexible plugin mechanism, and a transparent yet efficient synchronization layer that is independent of the modules from which applications are assembled.","","978-1-5386-2089-2","10.1109/CW.2017.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120305","","Virtual environments;Servers;Engines;Data models;Games;Computer architecture;Synchronization","","4","","22","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To save power, the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism is standardized by third generation partnership project and also is adopted in the NB-IoT specifications as important methods to obtain long battery life. However, current DRX schemes used in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) are inadequate to the large-scale NB-IoT system. In this paper, aim to obtain better power saving and balance weak-up latency performance as well as avoid the possible signaling storm in an NB-IoT system with massive devices, a grouping-based energy efficient DRX strategy is proposed. Moreover, different DRX schemes are devised for the group leader and group members to further reduce power consumption. A discrete time semi-Markov process is applied to numerically analyze the system performance and to obtain the power saving factor and weak-up latency. Simulations show the fact that how the various DRX parameters impact the system performance. Specifically, simulation results demonstrate our proposed DRX mechanism outperforms the LTE DRX scheme in terms of power-saving performance although at the slight and sustainable cost of latency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2789679","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571038,61471030); Important National Science and Technology Specific Projects of China(grant numbers:2016ZX03001011-004); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2016JBZ003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8246502","Discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism;discrete time semi-Markov process;Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT);power saving factor;weak-up latency","Long Term Evolution;Batteries;Internet of Things;System performance;Numerical models;Wireless communication;3GPP","","27","","33","IEEE","4 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity. Compared with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access system, the NOMA system with imperfect SIC yields better performance on the SE and the scale of connectivity, at the cost of high power consumption and low energy efficiency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876152","Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701258); Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor Program(grant numbers:RK002STP16001); Program for Jiangsu Six Top Talent(grant numbers:XYDXX-010); Program for High-Level Entrepreneurial and Innovative Talents Introduction(grant numbers:CZ0010617002); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20170906); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions(grant numbers:17KJB510044); NUPTSF(grant numbers:XK0010915026); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500158","Cognitive radio (CR);deep learning;heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT);imperfect successive interference cancelation (SIC);nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA);resource allocation (RA)","NOMA;Interference;Silicon carbide;Internet of Things;Machine learning;Resource management;Signal to noise ratio","","208","","39","IEEE","19 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices.

Here, we address this problem by self-coordination for IoT networks through learning from past communications. To this end, we first study low-complexity distributed learning approaches applicable in IoT communications. Then, we present a learning solution to adapt communication parameters of devices to the environment for maximizing energy efficiency and reliability in data transmissions. Furthermore, leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, we evaluate the performance of proposed distributed learning solution against the centralized coordination. Finally, we analyze the interplay amongst energy efficiency, reliability of communications against noise and interference over data channel, and reliability against adversarial interference over data and feedback channels. The simulation results indicate that compared to the state of the art approaches, both energy efficiency and reliability in IoT communications could be significantly improved using the proposed learning approach.

Multi-antenna multi-sine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information have been shown to be a promising building block of WPT. However, the current design is computationally too complex to be applied to large-scale WPT, where signals are sent across a large number (tens) of antennas and frequencies. This paper proposes efficient single/multi-user algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit waveforms that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity of the rectenna on the design of waveforms in single/multi-user systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial beamforming, obtained before optimizing power allocation across frequencies, turns out to be maximum ratio transmission. Nevertheless, in the general multi-user weighted-sum criterion maximization problem, optimizations in the frequency and the spatial domains are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, we also propose low-complexity algorithms based on asymptotic analysis, where the structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial beamforming can be found before optimizations. Simulation results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design in single/multi-user systems. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed algorithms (based on the nonlinear model) can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves at a computational cost much lower than the existing method. Simulation results also indicate that the large-scale WPT architecture can boost the end-to-end power transfer efficiency and the transmission range.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2017.2739112","EPSRC of UK(grant numbers:EP/P003885/1); CSC Imperial Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8008785","Wireless power transfer;energy harvesting;nonlinear model;massive MIMO;convex optimization","Optimization;Rectennas;Mathematical model;Algorithm design and analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Computational modeling","","54","","34","IEEE","11 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a Machine to Machine (M2M) platform able to monitor data acquisition, processing, and visualization. The use of SCoTv2 allows users to integrate several sources and obtain relevant information only by connecting their sensors with the platform.

In this context, large scale analytics is needed to extract knowledge and value from the data produced by these sensors. The ability to perform analytics on these data, however, is highly limited by the difficulties of collecting labels. Indeed, the machine learning techniques used to perform analytics rely upon data labels to learn and to validate results. Historically, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to gather labels, yet they cannot be directly used in the IoT because of poor human readability of sensor data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a framework for sensor data analytics which leverages the power of crowdsourcing through gamification to acquire sensor data labels. The framework uses gamification as a socially engaging vehicle and as a way to motivate users to participate in various labelling tasks. To demonstrate the framework proposed, a case study is also presented. Evaluation results show the framework can successfully translate gamification events into sensor data labels.","","978-1-5386-2011-3","10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039057","Internet of Things;Sensor Data;Gamification;Data Analytics;Machine Learning;Crowdsourcing","Labeling;Games;Crowdsourcing;Data analysis;Event detection;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms","","15","","26","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Large-scale IoT deployments will require mechanisms enabling the state of system components to be reliably determined to enable management systems to efficiently identify certain classes of overall system vulnerability. Such attestation mechanisms will need to support heterogeneous systems comprising equipment from many vendors, often with differing cost and security profiles. The Entity Attestation Token (EAT) [1] is an extensible and crypto-agile container for transporting claims about a device state in a verifiable manner. In its simplest form, the Entity Attestation Token can be implemented at very low cost in pure hardware, but it can scale to meet the requirements of complex systems. The Entity Attestation Token is built on the IETF COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption) standard. COSE provides a lightweight, flexible and crypto-agile container for a collection of standardized claims definitions — these are being defined in number of bodies including the IETF and GlobalPlatform. Of particular practical note is the strong support for Entity Attestation Token from a number of very significant vendors in the semiconductor industry. This paper outlines the technical foundations of the Entity Attestation Token as a mechanism for reliably transporting claims within an attestation framework, discusses some of the interoperability challenges and considers areas where further work may be required.","","978-1-83953-089-0","10.1049/cp.2019.0167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9038031","attestation;security;internet of things","","","","","","","19 Mar 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

For the reason that the computers lack of the domain knowledge and cognitive ability, it is hard for computers to recognize the melody of music or write score while listening to the music. Therefore, a music cognition system is introduced to cognate music and automatically write score based on machine learning methods. First, considering large-scale data processing is needed by machine learning algorithms and a number of music devices are involved in the cognition system through Internet, fog computing is adopted in the proposed architecture to efficiently allocate computing resources. Then, the system can collect, preprocess, and store raw music data on the fringe nodes. Meanwhile, these data will be transmitted from fog nodes to cloud servers to form music databases. Then, machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov model and Gaussian mixture model, are performed in cloud servers to recognize music melody.

One critical IoT application pertains to m-Health services which allow monitoring the health status of patients while providing the ability for a rapid response in emergency cases. Connecting healthcare services to the IoT brings forward new security threats and vulnerabilities that can jeopardize the patients' private data. In this paper, a novel security framework for m-Health IoT security is proposed using the concept of moving target defense (MTD). MTD allows the m-Health system to dynamically change its cryptographic keys to increase uncertainty on an attacker and secure the data. In the proposed scheme, the devices update their keys locally to eliminate the risk of revealing new keys while they are being shared with a gateway. A practical implementation is proposed based on bitslicing LED, a lightweight encryption cipher, to improve the performance of decrypting multiple packets at the same time. LED bitsliced implementation was tested on an ARM Cortex-A53 and was shown to consume half of the processor's instructions compared to the conventional implementation. The effect of applying MTD on the number of processor's instructions is evaluated and shown to be bounded.","2158-4001","978-1-5386-3025-9","10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326298","","Encryption;Logic gates;Light emitting diodes;Performance evaluation;Internet","","13","","19","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on the architectural enhancements for distributing the root-of-trust between both hardware and software components. This distribution of trust makes it difficult for a hardware-only or software-only attack to cripple the system. The proposed approach is applied to a motor control algorithm widely used in industrial IoT systems, consisting of third-party soft IP cores, where an attack on such a system can cripple it. The resulting implementation is evaluated by subjecting the system to multiple hardware Trojan attacks.

Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant.

To implement smart tourism services, park managers have introduced the Internet of things (IoT) to their parks, which has enabled the provision of diversified intelligent information services. However, most of the previous studies focused on 2D deployment of the IoT system to cover all targets, ignoring actual 3D topographic differences; their objectives rarely included the effectiveness of services generated from introducing the IoT; they assumed targets to be equally crucial, regardless of differences in tourism attractiveness (e.g., tourist attractions, view trails, and recreation facilities). Therefore, this study investigates 3D deployment of an IoT system to cover targets with different scores based on tourism attractiveness in a forest recreation park with optimal management service benefits, represented as a weighted sum of service quality index (SQI) and managerial setting attributes index (MSAI), so that the system collects the data from visitors equipped with wearable devices, and applies it to tasks such as physiological detection and positioning. This problem belongs to deployment and coverage problems, which have been shown to be NP-hard, and thus is also NP-hard. Therefore, this study further solves this problem by improved simulated annealing (ISA), including three neighborhood searching operators and the dynamic probability adjustment scheme.

However, this approach increases IoT development costs and system complexities, delay time to market, and ultimately lowers competitive advantages associated with delivering next-generation IoT designs. To overcome these challenges, existing, widely available, hardware can be utilized to successfully participate in distributed edge computing for IIoT systems. In this paper, an osmotic computing approach is used to illustrate how distributed osmotic computing and existing low-cost hardware may be utilized to solve complex, compute-intensive Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) deep learning problem from the edge, through the fog, to the network cloud layer of IIoT systems. At the edge layer, the C28x digital signal processor (DSP), an existing low-cost, embedded, real-time DSP that has very wide deployment and integration in several IoT industries is used as a case study for constructing real-time graph-based Coiflet wavelets that could be used for several analytic applications including deep learning pre-processing applications at the edge and fog layers of IIoT networks. Our implementation is the first known application of the fixed-point C28x DSP to construct Coiflet wavelets. Coiflet Wavelets are constructed in the form of an osmotic microservice, using embedded low-level machine language to program the C28x at the network edge. With the graph-based approach, it is shown that an entire Coiflet wavelet distribution could be generated from only one wavelet stored in the C28x based edge device, and this could lead to significant savings in memory at the edge of IoT networks. Pearson correlation coefficient is used to select an edge generated Coiflet wavelet and the selected wavelet is used at the fog layer for pre-processing and denoising IIoT data to improve data quality for fog layer based deep learning application. Parameters for implementing deep learning at the fog layer using LSTM networks have been determined in the cloud. For XAI, communication network noise is shown to have significant impact on results of predictive deep learning at IIoT network fog layer.","","978-1-5386-9555-5","10.1109/AIKE.2018.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8527474","Explainable Artificial Intelligence;Deep Learning;Real-Time;Industrial IoT;Wavelet Graph;Data Quality;Distributed Computing","Hardware;Wavelet analysis;Cloud computing;Logic gates;Real-time systems","","9","","56","IEEE","8 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, within each cluster, an asynchronous multiuser deep reinforcement learning (RL) scheme is developed to control the HO processes across the UEs in each cluster, in the goal of lowering the HO rate while ensuring certain system throughput. In this scheme, we use a deep neural network (DNN) as an HO controller learned by each UE via RL in a collaborative fashion. Moreover, we use supervised learning in initializing the DNN controller before the execution of RL to exploit what we already know with traditional HO schemes and to mitigate the negative effects of random exploration at the initial stage. Furthermore, we show that the adopted global-parameter-based asynchronous framework enables us to train faster with more UEs, which could nicely address the scalability issue to support large systems.

For instance we can easily build a network composed by multiple sensors distributed in a building in order to monitor temperature in different offices. This kind of architecture is generally centralized as all sensors are mainly programmed to periodically transmit their data to the sink. The specific IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) had been designed in order to enable such communications. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. In fact new applications may also consider peer-to-peer communications between any nodes of the network. In that case, RPL is not optimal as data packets are forwarded in respect with longer paths with larger metrics. In this paper we propose to study the effectiveness of RPL compared to a shortest path algorithm such like the Dijkstra's algorithm. We suggest to analyze peer-to-peer communications inside random wireless sensor network topologies with size limited to 250 nodes, corresponding to a reasonable cluster size. We have built a particular simulation environment named Network Analysis and Routing eVALuation (NARVAL). This toolbox permits to generate random topologies in order to study the impact of routing algorithms on the effectiveness of communication protocols. In our work, we first generated many random network topologies where we selected a sink node. We built the Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) from the chosen sink in respect with the RPL algorithm. We finally performed all paths between each couple of two distinct sensor nodes and compared them to the corresponding shortest paths obtained by the Dijkstra's algorithm. This approach permits to retrieve some statistics on the path extension between RPL and the Dijkstra's algorithm. We also analyzed the impact of the sink position and the network size on this path extension.","2375-0227","978-0-7695-5102-9","10.1109/MASCOTS.2013.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6730775","WSN;Routing;Simulation;6LoWPAN;RPL","Peer-to-peer computing;Network topology;Topology;Algorithm design and analysis;Routing;Routing protocols;Analytical models","","","","7","IEEE","3 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure communication between these heterogeneous devices. Among all the issues, the Group Key Management is one of the most difficult. Although different approaches have been proposed to solve it, very few of them consider the heterogeneous nature of the IoT.

This approach is an alternative to big data analytics systems that are often expensive to access, privacy-intrusive and allow discriminatory and profiling actions over citizens' data. On the contrary, large-scale decentralized networks are complex to manage and collective measurements, i.e. computations of aggregation functions, need to encounter several dynamics such as continuously changing input data streams and highly varying temporal demand for access to the collective measurements. This paper proposes a highly reactive self-adaptation model to tackle the challenge of dynamic computational demand in large-scale decentralized in-network aggregation. The self-adaptation process makes nodes self-aware about other nodes that join and leave the network and therefore it makes them capable of self-orchestrating the communication to improve accuracy and minimize communication cost. The model is simple, yet agile. This is shown when applied in DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service without introducing architectural changes. Evaluation using data from a real-world smart grid pilot project as well as extreme demand profiles that scale up and down the demand 50% on average confirm the cost-effectiveness of in-network aggregation empowered by self-adaptation. The findings are confirmed both in simulation and a large-scale live deployment in a cluster infrastructure with 3000 independent Java virtual machines each running a DIAS node. Overall, the results encourage new promising pathways towards the broader adoption of self-adaptive participatory data analytics in large-scale decentralized networks.","","978-1-5386-1465-5","10.1109/NCA.2017.8171353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8171353","self-adaptation;aggregation;accuracy;data analytics;decentralized network;participation;agent;gossip communication","Peer-to-peer computing;Computational modeling;Data analysis;Data models;Power system dynamics;Adaptation models;Aggregates","","4","","43","IEEE","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In large scale access networks, supporting urgent and reliable communications with their QoS demands becomes more challenging. Hence, network slicing within an SDN-based architecture brings numerous advantages to solve this problem by easily managing network resources and reserving part of the latter for urgent traffic and avoiding its performance degradation due to congestion. In this paper, we tackle the raised questions regarding scalability limitations by proposing a distributed slicing strategy based on coalitional game and matching theory over an SDN-based LoRaWAN architecture. In this context, resource reservation for LoRa slices and configuration optimization are performed closer to the edge at the gateway level. Simulation results performed over NS3 highlight the utility of the distributed slicing strategy in respecting quality of service (QoS) thresholds in terms of delay, throughput, energy consumption and improving reliability while providing complete isolation between LoRa slices.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2945254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855015","SDN;Internet of Things (IoT);LoRa;slicing admission control;resource reservation;resource allocation;large scale;distributed network slicing","Internet of Things;Resource management;Network slicing;Quality of service;Games;Scalability;Reliability","","33","","50","IEEE","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional access model, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) cannot provide the flexible fine-grained access control which is required due to dynamic changing users and environments. On the other hand, some other features of the IoT applications like constrained-resources devices and large-scale deployments make it very difficult to apply Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Furthermore, the ABAC mechanism cannot control the way that the requester uses the services once the requester obtains the access permission.

Reducing the energy consumption of the digital pre-processing block of these wireless sensor nodes is a method that can be used to minimize the total energy consumption of these nodes. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a technique that is proven to effectively decrease the energy consumption of large digital systems. This project applied DVFS on the pre-processing block of wireless sensor nodes in order to quantify the trade-off between the energy overhead of implementing a DVFS system, and the energy savings of the pre-processing block.

In essence, supporting efficient publish/subscribe systems requires data-oriented naming and efficient multicast. Since deployment of native IP-based multicast has failed, overlay-based multicast has become the practical choice. Since load balancing between heterogeneous nodes is an important issue, designing an optimal load balancing overlay network for publish/subscribe systems is a necessary endeavor. This study focuses on the optimal load balancing overlay design problem for topic-based publish/subscribe systems in a heterogeneous environment (in terms of node processing power, bandwidth, and reachability). The Minimum Idle Degree (MID) model is introduced to capture the heterogeneity of overlay nodes. Based on the MID model, new node load measures are defined that can accommodate heterogeneous server capacities and capture the node load in publish/subscribe systems more accurately than traditional measures. A new optimization problem, Maximum Minimum Idle Degree Topic-Connected Overlay (MMID-TCO), is established. This problem is NP-complete and a constant approximation algorithm does not exist for this problem (unless P=NP). Based on MID metrics, the Maximum Minimum Idle Degree Overlay Design Algorithm (MMID-ODA), which has polynomial time, is introduced. To improve performance, an approach that breaks down the problem into several small-scale problems by exploiting the potential inherent disjoint characteristic in the subscription table is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve better load balance than Min-Max-ODA in a heterogeneous environment.","1007-0214","","10.1016/S1007-0214(11)70079-7 ","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133353","optimal problem;load balancing;heterogeneity;topic-based;publish/subscribe","Peer to peer computing;Load management;Algorithm design and analysis;Subscriptions;Approximation algorithms;Servers;Publish-subscribe;Bandwidth allocation","","3","1","","","19 Jan 2012","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This proved to be a turning point for developing first-access electricity systems for the underserved locations around the world. However, there are planning and operation challenges due to lack of past data on such places. Deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and proliferation of smart infrastructures with additional sensors will lead to tremendous opportunities for gathering very useful data. For different stakeholders to access and manage these data, trusted and standardized mechanisms need to be in place. Storing proper data in a well-structured common format allows for collaborative research across disciplines, large-scale analytics, and sharing of algorithms and methodologies, in addition to improved customer service. Data standardization plays a more vital role in the context of electricity access in the underdeveloped countries, where there is no past data on generation or consumption as in utility grids. Data collected in a standard structure, being it for a short period of time, facilitate learning from the past experiences, monitoring the current projects, and delivering better results in the future endeavors. It will result in ways to better assist consumers and help the industry operate more efficiently by sharing data with different stakeholders. It can also enhance competition, thus making electricity accessible faster and to more people. The focus of this article is data standardization for first-access electricity systems, in general, and renewable energy-based microgrids, in particular. Different data sources and ways that the corresponding data can be exploited, technological and capacity constraints for storage of data, political and governance implications, as well as data security and privacy issues, are examined. This article is relevant to different stakeholders, such as investors, public utilities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and communities. Using the data standardization approach developed here, it is possible to create a much-needed first-access electricity system database. This will provide an important resource for project developers and energy companies to assess the potential of a certain unelectrified site, estimating its demand growth in time and establishing universal control systems that can seamlessly communicate with different components.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2019.2929621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809373","Data systems;IEC 61850;smart-grid communications;standardization in power systems;Sub-Saharan Africa;underserved communities;Universal Access to Electricity","Microgrids;Renewable energy sources;Information technology;Data collection;Electricity supply industry;Investment;Electricity supply industry;Power system economics;Energy management","","16","","50","CCBY","21 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One common aim of these strategies is to achieve smart manufacturing, which demands the interoperation, integration, and fusion of the physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing. As well, New IT [such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)] have played pivotal roles in promoting smart manufacturing. Data generated in the physical world can be sensed and transfered to the cyber world through IoT and the Internet, and be processed and analyzed by cloud computing, big data technologies to adjust the physical world. The physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing are integrated based on CPS. On the other hand, servitization has become a prominent trend in the manufacturing. Embracing the concept of “Manufacturing-as-a-Service,” manufacturing is provided as service for users. Because of the characteristics of interoperability and platform independence, services pave the way for large-scale smart applications and manufacturing collaboration. Combining New IT and services, this paper proposes a framework-New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing (SoSM). SoSM aims at facilitating the visions of smart manufacturing by making full use of New IT and services. Complementary to the framework of SoSM, the New IT driven typical characteristics of SoSM are also investigated and discussed, respectively.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723764","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51522501); Beijing Nova Program(grant numbers:Z161100004916063); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1101700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990538","Big data;cloud computing;cyber-physical integration;Internet of Things (IoT);manufacturing service;smart manufacturing","Manufacturing;Cloud computing;Big Data;Industries;Collaboration;Production","","247","","54","IEEE","25 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Powering the massive number of embedded devices is a key challenge of designing IoT, since batteries increase the devices' form factors and battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between passive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter communication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WP-BackCom) network. In this network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are deployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals to targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits data to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a carrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form random clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from and backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs. Furthermore, the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of backscatter parameters, including backscatter duty cycle, reflection coefficient, and the PB density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are quantified.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2017.2665629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7876867","Backscatter communication;stochastic geometry;network coverage;energy harvesting;wireless power transfer","Wireless communication;Energy harvesting;Backscatter;Stochastic processes","","154","1","32","IEEE","13 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the meantime, users' contexts (e.g., location, time, and surroundings), wildly utilized in the IoT scenario to better satisfy individuals' demands, raises privacy issues. To address these problems, we propose a privacy-preserving mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled context-aware service selection system over software defined networks (SDN) in IoT to provide suitable services for end users, where the edge nodes (ENs) cache and process information, acting as cooperative learners. Utilizing the users' feedback and the historical records monitored by the SDN-based network, our contextual online learning algorithm achieves high prediction accuracy. Besides, instead of considering them as individual items, we utilize a top-down cover tree structure to handle service data, which supports ever-increasing large-scale datasets and complex situations.

This opens the possibility of seeing many kinds of existing attacks, traditionally targeted at the Internet, also directed at IoT devices.

Nevertheless, securing IoT devices is a fundamental issue due to the relevant information handled in IoT networks. The intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most commonly used technique to detect intruders and acts as a second wall of defense when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection techniques, which are characterized by high detection rates and low false positives, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node, and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. Activating the anomaly detection technique simultaneously at each low-resource IoT device and all the time could generate a high-energy consumption. Thereby, we propose a game theoretic technique to activate anomaly detection technique only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur; hence, a balance between detection and false positive rates, and energy consumption is achieved. Even by combining between these two detection techniques, we observed that the number of false positives is still non null (almost equal to 5%). Thereby, to decrease further the false positive rate, a reputation model based on game theory is proposed. Simulation results show that this lightweight anomaly detection outperforms current anomaly detection techniques, since in scaling mode (i.e., when the number of IoT devices and attackers are high) it requires low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high detection and low false positive rates, almost 93% and 2%, respectively.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2017.2701551","European Project ITEA FUSE-IT and in part by the ANASTACIA Project; European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:731558); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7920414","And intrusion detection system;anomaly detection technique;game theory;IoT devices;reputation model","Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Simulation","","72","","36","IEEE","5 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This inherent flaw has manifested itself in the form of various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks orchestrated with the help of unsolicited IoT devices on the Internet. We are even seeing massive throughputs without the need for amplifications affecting large scale infrastructures on the Internet. Thus, understanding the nature of these attacks and quickly identifying infected devices becomes imperative to combat this situation. In this paper we present a model to classify unsolicited IoT devices in enterprises using machine learning (ML). Namely IP header information from darknet data is collected for analysis. We then consider multiple supervised ML algorithms to classify these Layer 3 headers. We evaluate these algorithms and compare their performances in terms of accurately identifying activities of malicious IoT devices on the Internet. Our results show that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have high recall and precision scores whereas NaiveBayes has the worst performance.

Previous schemes do not scale well with the large number of IoT devices. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a secure authentication scheme for IoT in the cloud. In our scheme, we use Chebyshev chaotic maps for authentication and elliptic curve cryptography for confidentiality and integrity. The proposed scheme achieve the security properties such as authentication, confidentiality and integrity in security analysis and achieve the efficiency in performance analysis.","","978-1-5090-6785-5","10.1109/IoT-SIU.2018.8519890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519890","IoT;Cloud;Authentication;Confidentiality;In-tegrity;Elliptical curve cryptography;Chebyshev chaotic maps","Authentication;Cloud computing;Sensors;Encryption;Chaotic communication","","2","","16","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical MCS service implementations utilize cloud-based centralized architectures, which consume a lot of computational resources and generate significant network traffic, both in mobile networks and toward cloud-based MCS services. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a natural choice to distribute MCS solutions by moving computation to network edge, since an MEC-based architecture enables significant performance improvements due to the partitioning of problem space based on location, where real-time data processing and aggregation is performed close to data sources. This in turn reduces the associated traffic in mobile core and will facilitate MCS deployments of massive scale. This paper proposes an edge computing architecture adequate for massive scale MCS services by placing key MCS features within the reference MEC architecture. In addition to improved performance, the proposed architecture decreases privacy threats and permits citizens to control the flow of contributed sensor data. It is adequate for both data analytics and real-time MCS scenarios, in line with the 5G vision to integrate a huge number of devices and enable innovative applications requiring low network latency. Our analysis of service overhead introduced by distributed architecture and service reconfiguration at network edge performed on real user traces shows that this overhead is controllable and small compared with the aforementioned benefits. When enhanced by interoperability concepts, the proposed architecture creates an environment for the establishment of an MCS marketplace for bartering and trading of both raw sensor data and aggregated/processed information.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2799707","Croatian Science Foundation (Human-centric Communications in Smart Networks)(grant numbers:8065); H2020 symbIoTe Project, through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:688156); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8272334","Mobile crowdsensing;mobile edge computing;MCS functional architecture;MEC reference architecture","Computer architecture;Task analysis;Mobile communication;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Mobile handsets;Mobile computing","","129","","31","OAPA","30 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the authors propose Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors (HEB), a paradigm that builds on the concepts of emergent behavior and hierarchical organization. Rather than explicitly programming all possible decisions in the vast space of ULSS scenarios, HEB relies on the emergent behaviors induced by local rules at each level of the hierarchy. The authors discuss the modifications to classical IoT architectures required by HEB, as well as the new challenges. They also illustrate the HEB concepts in reference to autonomous vehicles.

Specifically, the ICCF enhances sensor data processing performance by enabling horizontal data transfer in the Fog layer through connectionless name-based Fog-to-Fog data transmission. It utilizes the Fog node's distributed data processing power to achieve a satisfactory data processing performance, while communication with the Cloud is only required to report detected anomalies. Moreover, because the connectionless name-based scheme significantly reduces data connection overhead, this guarantees real-time communication and the ability of processing large-scale IoT data.

It helps to reduce unnecessary reader-tag interactions and the cost of collision avoidance algorithm in distributed data collection of RFID network. In large-scale distributed RFID networks, one of the most challenging tasks for redundant reader elimination is to improve the performance of distributed algorithms. This paper proposes a novel distributed redundant reader elimination algorithm based on the threshold selection process, named threshold selection algorithm (TSA), for RFID networks.

Indeed, deploying LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios must achieve two main goals: efficient communications among a large number of devices and resilience against dynamic channel conditions due to demanding environmental settings (e.g., the presence of many buildings). This work investigates adaptive mechanisms to configure the communication parameters of LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios. To this end, we develop FLoRa, an open-source framework for end-to-end LoRa simulations in OMNeT++. We then implement and evaluate the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism built into LoRa to dynamically manage link parameters for scalable and efficient network operations. Extensive simulations show that ADR is effective in increasing the network delivery ratio under stable channel conditions, while keeping the energy consumption low. Our results also show that the performance of ADR is severely affected by a highly-varying wireless channel. We thereby propose an improved version of the original ADR mechanism to cope with variable channel conditions. Our proposed solution significantly increases both the reliability and the energy efficiency of communications over a noisy channel, almost irrespective of the network size. Finally, we show that the delivery ratio of very dense networks can be further improved by using a network-aware approach, wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network.","2374-9709","978-1-5386-3416-5","10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406255","LoRa;configuration management;performance evaluation;adaptive data rate;reliability;energy efficiency","Logic gates;Network servers;Physical layer;Adaptive systems;Wireless communication;Adaptation models;Reliability","","169","","22","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current urban area commonly applies the strategy of “mixed collection, centralized transportation, centralized processing”, commonly known as the three segment management to recycle and dispose of refuse, which can not effectively solve massive waste issues. This paper is to introduce the challenges and solutions of garbage classification, and to solve the inevitable problems of “sanitation management”, “solid waste classification”, “recycling station data feedback”, and “surrounding environment monitoring”, so as to recycle of garbage efficiently and harmlessly. Based on the research and rich engineering experience, we have proposed the digital dynamic sanitation management, the cloud computing architecture, the grid large-scale real-time monitoring of solid waste recycling stations feedback, the surrounding water and air quality on-line monitoring subsystems.

However, an arbitrary selection of a reference could prove fatal, if an erroneous sensor is inadvertently chosen. To avert single point of dependence, and to improve estimator performance, we propose unbiased reference-free algorithms. Although our focus is on reference-free solutions, the proposed framework allows the incorporation of additional references, if available.

Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms.

How to meet the demands of massive connection has become a key problem for IC-IoT. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as a code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique has been intensively investigated. With SCMA, each user employs different sub-carrier frequencies for transmission, and different users can share the same sub-carrier frequency via superposition coding. The spectrum efficiency is thus improved. However, designing large-scale codebook sets is still an open problem for SCMA. In this paper, a new lattice-based codebook design method is proposed via mother constellation optimization. First, the optimization problem of the mother constellation is formulated. Through analysis, the problem can be converted into two sub-problems. Accordingly, we first use the lattice theory to find a constellation containing infinite points with large coding gain. After that, we search for a boundary that contains a set of points via spherical packing. Such an approach enables us to obtain a real constellation satisfying a power saving criterion. Secondly, the mother constellation with large power variance is obtained from the real multi-dimensional constellation. Finally, lattice-based codebooks are generated by combining the mother constellation and the mapping matrices with constellation rotation. Simulations demonstrate that the designed codebooks have improved bit error rate (BER) performance with large codebook size, especially at high signal to noise ratio (SNR).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2938637","Natural Science and Technology Major Projects of China(grant numbers:2017ZX03001001-004); Zhengzhou University(grant numbers:32210907,32211247); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821310","Information-centric Internet of Things (IC-IoT);non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);sparse code multiple access (SCMA);lattice theory;spherical packing","Lattices;Constellation diagram;NOMA;Encoding;Internet of Things;Optimization;Bit error rate","","17","","43","CCBY","30 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The thousand‐fold wireless traffic increase anticipated by 2020 and the global recognition of the importance of green communications, however, pose very tough challenges for fifth generation (5G) design. The design metric of spectrum efficiency (SE) maximization, which was highly emphasized in previous communication systems, will have to be jointly pursued with, amongst other metrics, energy efficiency (EE). In this chapter, we will describe green network design considerations from the perspective of network architecture, signaling and control, and high SE and EE transmission techniques. The motivations, requirements, and worldwide activities for green radio are introduced, and one particular EE and SE co‐design framework is presented for link‐level optimization. The impact of system parameters such as frequency bandwidth, total power, antenna number, and transceiver number on EE–SE performance is analyzed. Promising 5G technologies, such as large scale antenna systems and non‐orthogonal multiple access are investigated in terms of EE–SE co‐design. To satisfy user requirements, future networks should be user‐centric rather than cell‐centric, thus leading to 5G networks with “no more cells”. C‐RAN, a soft radio access architecture and an enabling element for 5G key technologies, is presented, describing how the baseband is centralized and virtualized to flexibly allocate resource and manage interference to save both radiated and circuit power. Since the future network will be more heterogeneous, with fluctuating traffic volumes and diversified services, a fundamental rethinking of signaling and control design in 5G is necessitated to facilitate energy saving. Finally, an aggregator‐based signaling optimization scheme that can accommodate trillions of wireless nodes in the Internet of Things is described. It is anticipated that 5G networks and beyond will be softer and greener.","","9781118979891","10.1002/9781118979846.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8043161.pdf&bkn=8039779&pdfType=chapter","","5G mobile communication;Green products;Wireless communication;Mobile computing;Power demand;Optimization","","","","","","22 Sep 2017","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"

Knowing what VOCs are in the air can help us remove the main cause that vents VOC materials in order to maintain clean air quality. In this work, we present VOCkit, an IoT sensor kit for non-chemical experts to easily detect and classify different types of VOCs. VOCkit combines miniature chemically-designed fluorometric sensors for recognizing VOCs with an embedded imaging system for classification. Exposing the fluorometric sensors with various VOCs, result in photophysical property change of each fluorescent compound, which composes the sensors, and the synergistic combination of the changes create unique individual fluorescent color patterns respectively to the VOC material. The fluorescent color change pattern is captured using a camera and the images are processed with machine learning algorithms on the embedded platform for VOC classification.

Digital systems can exploit this error tolerance to increase their energy efficiency, which is crucial in high performance wearable electronics and in emerging low power systems for the internet-of-things. A dynamic energy-accuracy trade-off brings an extra degree of freedom for system level power management. We introduce the concept of Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling and illustrate its analogy to Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling. Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling proves to have higher energy gains at most output qualities compared to other approximate computing alternatives. This work further generalizes the Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling concept to pipelined structures and quantifies its energy overhead. Shallow pipelined multipliers with two to four dynamic accuracy modes can be supported with limited (<; 10-20%) overhead, resulting in significant energy savings of up to 90% or more for less than 2% mean error. DVAS is finally applied to a JPEG image processing application, demonstrating large system level gains without noticeable impact to user or application.","","978-1-4673-8009-6","10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273520","approximate computing;voltage scaling;DVAS;Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling;scalable effort;approximate multiplier","Accuracy;Registers;Energy dissipation;Pipelines;Pipeline processing;Power system dynamics;Energy consumption","","48","2","14","IEEE","24 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Given Industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. The scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an Industry 4.0 system. This includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. The proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the CPS dataset of sensors and actuators and the UNSW-NB15 dataset of network traffic. The results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-Industry 4.0 systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844794","UNSW at ADFA Project OP001(grant numbers:1Z6300PS4,Z6300PS45623); Australian Department of Defence(grant numbers:DST-CERA 135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374422","Industry 4.0;threat intelligence;cyber-attacks;cyber-physical systems (CPS);Internet of Things (IoT);cloud;fog;beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMM)","Industries;Manufacturing;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Actuators;Security;Cyber-physical systems","","90","","55","OAPA","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming.

Accelerated by the innovation process in the public service sector, the digital public services must meet the expectations of the new wave of users that can't anymore dissociate their daily activities from the large-scale use of smart technologies. IoT has already proven to better sustain the sensing and connectivity, becoming thus an efficient tool to address a broader range of qualitative public services and to proactively involve the more demanding citizen.

To manage them, IoT frameworks rely on Big Data ecosystems hosted in the cloud to provide scalable storage systems and to achieve scalable processing. Although these ecosystems scale well to process large sizes of data, in many cases this is done naively. Many datasets, such as IoT Energy measurement data, consist, even partially, of attributes that can be indexed to avoid unnecessary and costly data scan at these scales. In this work, we propose the iBig architecture thatprovides secondary indexing to Big Data processing for energy IoT datasets. Indexes are considered as metadata stored in a separate component integrated in the ecosystem.

These temporary associations need to be considered while at the same time taking into account security and privacy aspects. In this work, we discuss a selection of current activities being carried out by different standardization bodies for the development of suitable technologies to be deployed in IoT environments.

Therefore, the paradigm of information-driven distributed sensing (IDDS) is essential to achieve efficient inference, where the resources are spent only on sensing and communicating valuable information. In this paper, we consider the problem of IDDS for efficient Bayesian inference with exponential family distributions. We first propose a centralized algorithm (C-IDDS) where a centralized controller exists to make sensing decisions for the sensing agents. As the centralized algorithm does not scale well in large systems, we continue to design a distributed algorithm (D-IDDS) where each individual sensing agents can make their own sensing decisions independently. Both C-IDDS and D-IDDS are online algorithms which can adapt to stochastic system conditions without any future information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithms can achieve an asymptotically optimal system-wide utility. A real testbed has been built to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in real-world environments. Using the data from the real-world testbed and comparing with some baseline methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed C-IDDS and D-IDDS algorithms.","2155-5494","978-1-5386-4281-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397111","","Sensors;Inference algorithms;Energy consumption;Bayes methods;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Scheduling","","3","","24","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, traditional data dissemination relies mainly on the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and thus much energy is wasted. With the development of 5G communication technologies, especially the mobile edge computing (MEC), it is believed that the edge server will become promising and more pervasively deployed. Despite computational offloading, the edge servers are also capable of communicational offloading. Therefore, to achieve data dissemination in an efficient way, we propose an edge-aided data dissemination system, in which the mobile edge servers are used to disseminate different segments of data objects. After that, IoT nodes exchange segments with each other to collect the entire data objects. In our work, we design the installation mechanism and data propagation protocol to not only ensure integrality of the data objects transmitted but also avoid the transmission conflicts. Furthermore, we design an adaptive protocol to achieve efficient data dissemination for heterogeneous IoT networks. We conduct extensive experiments and large-scale simulations.

The Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) architectures are the leading examples of such an approach. However, forwarding data by name incurs storage and communication complexities that are orders of magnitude larger than solutions based on forwarding data using addresses. Furthermore, the specific algorithms used in NDN and CCNx have been shown to have a number of limitations. The Addressable Data Networking (ADN) architecture is introduced as an alternative to NDN and CCNx. ADN is particularly attractive for large-scale deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT), because it requires far less storage and processing in relaying nodes than NDN. ADN allows things and data to be denoted by names, just like NDN and CCNx do. However, instead of replacing the waist of the Internet with named-data forwarding, ADN uses an address-based forwarding plane and introduces an information plane that seamlessly maps names to addresses without the involvement of end-user applications. Simulation results illustrate the order of magnitude savings in complexity that can be attained with ADN compared to NDN.","","978-1-4503-4966-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7946860","","Routing protocols;IP networks;Routing;Computer architecture;Complexity theory;Internet of Things","","","","44","","15 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT backend with cloud computing can present new ways to offer services that are massively scalable, can be dynamically configured, and delivered on demand with large scale infrastructure resources. However, a single cloud infrastructure might be unable to deal with the increasing demand of cloud services in which hundreds of users might be accessing cloud resources, leading to a big data problem and the need for efficient frameworks to handle a large number of user requests for IoT services. These challenges require new functional elements and provisioning schemes. To this end, we propose the usage of multi-clouds with IoT which can optimize the user requirements by allowing them to choose best IoT services from many services hosted in various cloud platforms and provide them with more infrastructure and platform resources to meet their requirements. This paper presents a novel framework for dynamic and secure IoT services access across multi-clouds using the cloud on-demand model. To facilitate multi-cloud collaboration, novel protocols are designed and implemented on cloud platforms. The various stages involved in the framework for allowing users access to IoT services in multi-clouds are service matchmaking (i.e., to choose the best service matching user requirements), authentication (i.e., a lightweight mechanism to authenticate users at runtime before granting them service access), and SLA management (including, SLA negotiation, enforcement, and monitoring). SLA management offers benefits like negotiating required service parameters, enforcing mechanisms to ensure that service execution in the external cloud is according to the agreed SLAs and monitoring to verify that the cloud provider complies with those SLAs. The detailed system design to establish secure multi-cloud collaboration has been presented. Moreover, the designed protocols are empirically implemented on two different clouds, including OpenStack and Amazon AWS. Experiments indicate that the proposed system is scalable, authentication protocols result only in a limited overhead compared to standard authentication protocols, and any SLA violation by a cloud provider could be recorded and reported back to the user.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493478","Authentication;IoT;IoT services;multi-clouds;security;secure collaboration;service level agreement;service matchmaking","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Authentication;Protocols;Monitoring;Internet of Things","","19","","29","OAPA","16 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These systems leverage the error resilience of applications to obtain high energy efficiency, at the expense of tolerable reductions in the output quality. Hardware datapath operators able to reconfigure their precision and power consumption at runtime are key components of such systems. However, most implementations of these operators require manual, architecture-specific modifications and tend to have large power overheads compared to standard designs, when working at maximum precision. One promising design-independent alternative is dynamic voltage and accuracy scaling, whose adoption, however, is hindered by incompatibilities with standard design flows. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for the design of energy-quality scalable operators; our solution leverages runtime tuning of transistors threshold voltages to obtain a fine-grain control of the speed and power consumption of standard-cells within an operator. Thanks to the additional flexibility provided by this fine-grain knob, our method overcomes the main limitations of previous solutions, at the cost of a small area overhead. We demonstrate our approach on a 28 nm FDSOI technology; by exploiting the strong effect of back-gate biasing on threshold voltage, we achieve a power consumption reduction of more than 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, for the same precision.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2018.2834400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355960","Energy-quality tradeoff;low-power design","Hardware;Adders;Delays;Standards;Power demand;Runtime;Computer architecture","","2","","39","IEEE","8 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper argues that it is feasible to employ a large number of mobile vehicles in smart city to construct a large-scale low-cost delivery infrastructure using opportunistic routing to improve the city's social welfare. To this end, a low-cost good delivery system (LCGDS) with opportunistic relay is proposed to meet the requirements of good delivery. In LCGDS, an enormous number of mobile vehicles constitute a stable, highly reliable, low-cost infrastructure with large transportation capabilities, called the mobile Internet of mission-critical things (M-IoMCT). The main contributions of the LCGDS are: 1) demonstrate the technological feasibility of M-IoMCT for delivering goods through mobile vehicles in a “ride-sharing” fashion with low costs and 2) in order to increase the reliability of goods transmission, the LCGDS proposes mobile vehicle selection algorithm which effectively selects a vehicle with higher probability of arriving at the destination. Both theoretical and experimental simulation results show that the performance of the LCGDS outperforms those of other solutions. Compared with other solutions, our results demonstrate that the costs in the LCGDS are only about 24% of the costs in the origin goods transmission scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2825250","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772554); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB046305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8339515","Mobile vehicular networks;mobile Internet of mission-critical things;low cost;reliability","Smart cities;Transportation;Relays;Reliability;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Minimization","","40","","50","OAPA","17 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these technologies bring with them a rapid increase in traffic, thereby putting more load on networks. It is hard to extend the traditional fully distributed architecture and distributed aggregation mechanism to a large scale, because they suffer several drawbacks by using the data plane as a bus to transfer the control discovery messages, which increases the traffic on that plane. Consequently, to solve this issue, a general architecture and discovery mechanism are introduced in this paper with open-level control (OLC) plane architecture, thus providing better scalability in an software defined networking (SDN) network. Regarding OLC, the backbone for different domains and the discovery process for providing a network general view are considered. OLC can scale up the network with high performance even during high traffic. In particular, it has high transparency, with there being no need to change the hardware, software, or protocols on the host side. Finally, the results from a 22 PC testbed verify that OLC offers a reduction in the number of discovery packets in the data plane of 84.2%, 55.2% faster discovery time and scaling up the number of subnets in an SDN network 3.2 times more than with the traditional distributed architecture and mechanism. Moreover, it provides an approximately steady rediscovery time of 4.34 secs even with very high load.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848638","Brunel University London; AL-Qadisiyah University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387823","Distributed management;distributed-centralized management;Ethernet networks;intra and inter domains;scalability;software-defined networking","Protocols;Computer architecture;Scalability;Complexity theory;Switches;Internet of Things","","3","","29","CCBY","18 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then establish a large-scale linear programming problem to find the minimum electric power consumption of the IoT system where ambient radio and on-chip battery are the sole energy sources. Specifically, a hybrid energy harvesting protocol combining millimeter wave and microwave below 6GHz is presented to enhance system sustainability. Two typical energy harvesting modes are proposed, of which the first mode performs better when dealing with long-term Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication service, while the second mode is more suited to occasional short-term energy sharing. When machine type communication device is abundantly charged at the beginning, we further obtain the closed-form expression revealing the ratio relationship between average electric power consumption under both modes, which is explicitly related to: (a) initial battery energy level of machine type network nodes, (b) service-oriented hybrid energy harvest (EH) protocol configuration, (c) system operation time and (4) fundamental electric and battery consumption of the whole system.

As more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices with measurement and/or control capability are designed and deployed for a more stable and efficient power system, the role of communication network has become more important. To evaluate the performance of control algorithms for inter-dependent power grid and communication network, a test bed that could simulate inter-dependent power grid and communication network is desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a novel co-simulator, which would effectively evaluate IoT-aided algorithms for scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances. There are three major features of our co-simulator: 1) large-scale test is achieved by distributed modules that are designed based on a Turing-indistinguishable approach; 2) remote servers or test devices are controlled by local graphical user interface (we only need to configure the simulator on a local server); 3) a software virtual network approach is employed to emulate real networks, which significantly reduces the cost of real-world test beds. To evaluate our co-simulator, two energy consumption scheduling algorithms are implemented. Experimental results show that our co-simulator could effectively evaluate these methods. Thus our co-simulator is a powerful tool for utility companies and policy makers to commission novel IoT devices or methods in future smart grid infrastructure.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753463","Grant HDTRA(grant numbers:1-14-1-0055); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039164","Smart grid;IoT;real time;large scale experimentation;software virtual network","Communication networks;Smart grids;Software;Servers;Real-time systems;Power system stability","","40","","22","OAPA","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Clear trends indicate that utilities are looking for an upgrade of communication solutions that are able to support massive connections, higher data rate, and lower latency. To achieve this goal, ownership or self-licensing is seen by the utilities as a much more cost effective method of accessing the spectrum. Nevertheless, for many countries, existing narrowband spectrum allocation are likely to remain unchanged for five to ten years due to existing licensed systems under operation. To avoid the difficulty of spectrum refarming, this paper introduces an innovative communication technology - Internet of Things-Grid (IoT-G) - which achieves excellent broadband transmission performances by aggregating existing fragmented narrowband spectrum. This technology inherits several key air interface design elements of 3GPP Release 15 IoT features as well as a number of low-latency design concepts from 3GPP 5G systems. Building upon the cellular ecosystem, IoT-G has a mature industrial chain including end-to-end chipsets, terminals and network equipment.

Therefore, improvements for quality of service have become a critical issue. Traditional packets scheduling algorithms cannot meet the requirements of the large-scale IoT systems. In this paper, a novel scheduling approach is proposed for different data classes (types) to be exchanged between heterogeneous nodes of a generic IoT infrastructure. The possible ways of organizing these classes depending on different metrics, such as time latency, reliability, and data loss, are investigated. The proposed approach has the advantage of being able to tune the priorities and network characteristics to reach a specifically desired performance state. Since each type of packets is considered separately, it is possible to prioritize them, by tuning the related parameters, which changes the priorities between packets. The numerical results presented show that the new approach performs better than the existing typical scheduling approaches.

This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by leveraging the recently introduced system-level approach (SLA) to controller synthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions of separability for control objective functions and system constraints such that the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a distributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel subproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity) constraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local models and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintain the convexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a consequence, the resulting synthesis methods have O(1) complexity relative to the size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control problems of interest, such as (localized) LQR and LQG,H2 optimal control with joint actuator and sensor regularization, and (localized) mixed H2/L1 optimal control problems, satisfy these notions of separability, and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance, actuator, and sensing density, and average versus worst-case performance for a large-scale power inspired system.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2018.2819246","Air Force Office of Scientific Research; National Science Foundation; Huawei and Google; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325319","Constrained and structured optimal control;decentralized control;large-scale systems;system-level synthesis (SLS)","Optimal control;Optimization;Actuators;Scalability;Delays;Information exchange;Internet of Things","","53","","34","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its key features (long range, low power and low cost) show that LoRa technology can be an appropriate alternative for localization in both large-scale indoor and outdoor environments.

This framework contains two modules: 1) offline training of passenger-hunting recommendation model (OT-PHRM) and 2) online application of passenger-hunting recommendation model (OA-PHRM).

In particular, for the input of two DCNNs, we not only consider contextual features of taxi driving, region features and valuable statistical features, but also combine individual features into meaningful ones. In the module OA-PHRM, we propose DL-PHRec, which calculates three prediction values using two trained DCNNs in OT-PHRM in real time, and then recommends a personal ranking-list of regions to each taxi driver according to their scores.

To fill this void, we propose to adopt cleanslate network architecture in the core network that decouples locators from network addresses, and towards this end, we propose MF-IoT, which is centered around the MobilityFirst architecture that focuses on mobility handling. MF-IoT enables efficient communication between devices from different local domains, as well as communication between devices and the infrastructure network. The MF-IoT network layer smoothly handles mobility during communication without interrupting the applications. This is achieved through a transparent translation mechanism at the gateway node that bridges an IoT domain and the core network. In the core network, we leverage MobilityFirst functionalities in providing efficient mobility support for billions of mobile devices through long, persistent IDs, while in the local IoT domain, we use short, local IDs for energy efficiency. By seamlessly translating between the two types of IDs, the gateway organically stitches these two parts of the network. Through large scale simulation studies, we show that MFIoT is able to achieve the four features we envisioned for an IoT system, with performance optimizations in reducing network traffic load, avoiding congestion, and ensuring fast and timely packet delivery.","","978-1-4673-9948-7","10.1109/IoTDI.2015.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471357","IoT;Network architecture","Sensors;Computer architecture;IP networks;Servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","","9","","27","IEEE","19 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The computation of DCNNs is memory intensive due to large feature maps and neuron connections, and the performance highly depends on the capability of hardware resources. With the recent trend of wearable devices and Internet of Things, it becomes desirable to integrate the DCNNs onto embedded and portable devices that require low power and energy consumptions and small hardware footprints. Recently stochastic computing (SC)-DCNN demonstrated that SC as a low-cost substitute to binary-based computing radically simplifies the hardware implementation of arithmetic units and has the potential to satisfy the stringent power requirements in embedded devices. In SC, many arithmetic operations that are resource-consuming in binary designs can be implemented with very simple hardware logic, alleviating the extensive computational complexity. It offers a colossal design space for integration and optimization due to its reduced area and soft error resiliency. In this paper, we present HEIF, a highly efficient SC-based inference framework of the large-scale DCNNs, with broad applications including (but not limited to) LeNet-5 and AlexNet, that achieves high energy efficiency and low area/hardware cost. Compared to SC-DCNN, HEIF features: 1) the first (to the best of our knowledge) SC-based rectified linear unit activation function to catch up with the recent advances in software models and mitigate degradation in application-level accuracy; 2) the redesigned approximate parallel counter and optimized stochastic multiplication using transmission gates and inverse mirror adders; and 3) the new optimization of weight storage using clustering. Most importantly, to achieve maximum energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy, HEIF considers holistic optimizations on cascade connection of function blocks in DCNN, pipelining technique, and bit-stream length reduction. Experimental results show that in large-scale applications HEIF outperforms previous SC-DCNN by the throughput of 4.1×, by area efficiency of up to 6.5×, and achieves up to 5.6× energy improvement.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2018.2852752","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:FA8750-17-2-0021); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61133004,61502019); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1739748,CNS-1704662); Consolider(grant numbers:CSD2007-00050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403283","ASIC;convolutional neural network;deep learning;energy-efficient;optimization;stochastic computing (SC)","Hardware;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Neurons;Optimization;Convolutional neural networks","","51","","61","IEEE","4 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2541999","European Union Seventh Framework Programme through the CityPulse Project(grant numbers:603095); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447851","Data analytics framework;smart cities;Data analytics framework;smart cities","Smart cities;Data analytics;Distributed databases;Semantics;Control systems;Environmental monitoring;Telecommunication services;Medical services;Digital systems;Knowledge discovery","","172","","42","OAPA","20 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The cloud services used to store and process sensitive data are often come out to be vulnerable to outside threats. Furthermore, to analyze streaming IoT data swiftly, they are in need of a fast and efficient system. The Paper will envision the aspects of complexity dealing with real time data from various devices in parallel, building solution to ingest data from different IOT devices, forming a secure platform to process data in a short time, and using various techniques of IOT edge computing to provide meaningful intuitive results to users. The paper envisions two modules of building a real time data analytics system. In the first module, we propose to maintain confidentiality and integrity of IoT data, which is of paramount importance, and manage large-scale data analytics with real-time data collection from various IoT devices in parallel. We envision a framework to preserve data privacy utilizing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) such as Intel SGX, end-to-end data encryption mechanism, and strong access control policies. Moreover, we design a generic framework to simplify the process of collecting and storing heterogeneous data coming from diverse IoT devices. In the second module, we envision a drone-based data processing system in real-time using edge computing and on-device computing.

These data streams are then consumed by pervasive applications, i.e. data consumers, to offer ubiquitous services. The data quality (DQ) is a key criteria for IoT data consumers especially when considering the inherent uncertainty of sensor-enabled data. However, DQ is a highly subjective concept and there is no standard agreement of how to determine “good” data. Moreover, the combinations of considered measured attributes and associated DQ information are as diverse as the needs of data consumers. This introduces expensive overheads for data consumers that desire a specifically built system for managing their DQ information. To effectively handle these various perceptions of DQ, we propose a Model-Driven Architecture-based approach that allows the data consumer to easily and efficiently express, through models, his vision of DQ and its requirements using an easy-to-use graphical model editor. The defined DQ specifications are then automatically transformed to generate an entire infrastructure for DQ management that fits perfectly the data consumer's requirements.

In this era, minimizing power consumption becomes a primary concern of system-on-chip designers. Ultralow power (ULP) very large-scale integration circuits have been receiving considerable interest from both academia and industry as the best-suited techniques for IoT devices, which can take full advantage of power-saving that voltage scaling potentially achieves. Consequently, research on ULP designs has begun to yield tangible outcomes, namely ULP circuits. However, little attention has been paid to ULP network-on-chip (NoC), although the NoC is an essential of the ULP chips, and its power consumption accounts for a significant portion of the total power. This paper focuses on ULP NoCs, and presents a new power management method that exploits delay versus temperature characteristics of ULP circuits. Recent studies on ULP circuits show that delay versus temperature characteristics are fundamentally different from normal circuits, i.e., the delay of the ULP circuits implemented in state-of-the-art bulk CMOS operating at low supply voltages or in FinFET technologies decreases with increasing temperature, a phenomenon known as the temperature effect inversion (TEI). Starting with an intuition that at a certain temperature point, power savings without performance penalty can be achieved by increasing the router frequency to create the opportunity to turn off some routers in ULP NoCs, or by decreasing the NoC supply voltage level, an optimization method is presented to maximize the power savings with minor performance penalty. To validate the proposed method, a concrete ULP NoC simulator, TEI-Noxim, has been developed. Experimental results demonstrate that TEI-aware NoC achieves an average of 36.0% power reduction over 21 applications.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2693269","IT Research and Development Program of MSIP/KEIT (Development of Intelligent Semiconductor Common Platform Technology for Smart Devices)(grant numbers:2016-0-00088); U.S. National Science Foundation through the Software and Hardware Foundations Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7896585","Network-on-chip (NoC);system-on-chip (SoC);temperature effect inversion (TEI);ultralow power (ULP) design","Ions;Power demand;Delays;Temperature;Logic gates;Routing;System-on-chip","","16","","41","IEEE","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, it remains an outstanding problem to combine IoT technology with existing grids. To facilitate deployment of IoT-based grids in domestic environments, we propose IoT-grid, a programmable, small-scale, direct current (DC) grid, that can be easily implemented with low-power hardware with limited processing capacity. The proposed grid adopts relatively cheap DC-DC converters which not only provide high conversion efficiency but also accommodate existing small-scale DC power systems (e.g. solar panels). We then explore the communication aspects of IoT-grid, namely, control and monitoring functions. We observe that processing delays of IoT devices have large impact on IoT-grid, which cause a chain of control commands to take considerable longer time as the number of commands increases. To mitigate this problem, we propose a mechanism based on sending burst commands with scheduled responses. Our experimental results show that, in the presence of processing delays, this method can significantly reduce the overall response time.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841917","","","","13","","41","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then propose an energy management scheme that consists of: (1) energy-aware mode switching strategy which allows sensor nodes to perform dedicated energy harvesting based on their current energy level and (2) cluster head selection algorithm which considers current and average of past energy levels of sensor nodes to achieve a balance between network performance and lifetime. Furthermore, for reliable intracluster reporting, we propose a channel management strategy to assign the best quality channel to the sensor nodes in terms of stability and reliability.

While such sensors have been shown to be feasible for air flow measurement, the applicability for water flows has not been addressed yet because the thermal short circuit due to the high thermal conductivity of the fluid strongly influences the performance of the sensor. The sensor in this paper uses a modified calorimetric principle with thermoresistive heat transfer, where the sensing elements are implemented by simple copper leads.

This eliminates the need to share the credentials of the protected resource (e.g., server) with all connected devices, thus overcoming the weaknesses of conventional client-server authentication. To reduce the energy consumption associated with secure data transfers, dynamic energy-quality tradeoff is introduced to save energy when lower security level (or, equivalently, quality in the security subsystem) is acceptable. Energy-quality scaling is introduced at several levels of abstraction, from the individual components in the security subsystem to the network protocol level. The analysis on an MICA 2 mote platform shows that the proposed scheme is robust against different types of attacks and reduces the energy consumption of IoT devices by up to 69% for authentication and authorization, and up to 45% during data transfer, compared to a conventional IoT device with fixed key size.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2875472","Ministry of Education - Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2016-T2-1-150); National University of Singapore(grant numbers:R-263-000-C50-133); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489899","Authentication;energy-quality scalability;Internet of Things (IoT);network security;physically unclonable functions (PUFs)","Authentication;Protocols;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Hardware;Error correction codes","","44","","68","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the “things” coordinate decisions and act collectively on shared information, feedback is introduced between them. Multiple feedback loops are thus closed over a shared, general-purpose network. Traditional feedback control is unsuitable for design of IoT control because it relies on high-rate periodic communication and is ignorant of the shared network resource. Therefore, recent event-based estimation methods are applied herein for resource-aware IoT control allowing agents to decide online whether communication with other agents is needed, or not. While this can reduce network traffic significantly, a severe limitation of typical event-based approaches is the need for instantaneous triggering decisions that leave no time to reallocate freed resources (e.g., communication slots), which hence remain unused. To address this problem, novel predictive and self triggering protocols are proposed herein. From a unified Bayesian decision framework, two schemes are developed: 1) self triggers that predict, at the current triggering instant, the next one and 2) predictive triggers that check at every time step, whether communication will be needed at a given prediction horizon. The suitability of these triggers for feedback control is demonstrated in hardware experiments on a cart-pole, and scalability is discussed with a multivehicle simulation.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2894628","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:TR 1433/1-1); Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems; Cyber Valley Initiative; Max Planck Society; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624412","Distributed control;event-based state estimation;feedback control;Internet of Things (IoT);predictive triggering;resource-aware control;self triggering","Internet of Things;State estimation;Sensors;Control systems;Feedback loop;Feedback control","","22","","52","IEEE","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems.

Some industrial IoT applications require ingesting millions of records per second, while processing queries on recently ingested and historical data. Unfortunately, existing database systems targeting multidimensional data exhibit low per-node ingestion performance, and even if they can scale horizontally in distributed settings, they require large number of nodes to meet such ingest demands. For this reason, in this paper we present a single-node datastore able to ingest multidimensional sensor data at very high rates. Its design centers around a two-level indexing structure, wherein the global index is an in-memory R*-tree and the local indices are serialized kd-trees. This study is confined to records with numerical indexing fields and range queries, and covers ingest throughput, query response time, and storage footprint. We show that the adopted design streamlines data ingestion and offers ingress rates two orders of magnitude higher than those of a selection of open-source database systems, namely Percona Server, SQLite, and Druid. Our prototype also reports query response times comparable to or better than those of Percona Server and Druid, and compares favorably in terms of storage footprint. We believe the experience reported here is valuable to researchers and practitioners interested in building database systems for high-velocity multidimensional sensor data.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8257956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257956","","Indexing;Time factors;Servers;Prototypes;Query processing","","5","","34","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main advantages of the proposed segmented modified fractional wavelet filter (SMFrWF) are reduced computation (time) complexity and energy consumption compared to the state-of-the-art low-memory 2-D DWT computation methods. In particular, the conventional convolution-based DWT is very fast but requires large random access memory (RAM), as the entire image needs to be in the system memory. The fractional wavelet filter (FrWF) requires only a small RAM but has high complexity due to multiple readings of image lines. The proposed SMFrWF avoids the multiple readings of image lines, thus reducing the memory read access time and, thereby, the complexity. We evaluated the proposed SMFrWF through MATLAB simulations with 70 popular gray-scale test images of dimensions ranging from 256×256 up to 8192×8192 pixels. The results show that for images of size 2048 × 2048 pixels, the proposed SMFrWF (with four segments per line) has 16.8% and 53.6% lower time complexities than the conventional DWT and FrWF, respectively. The proposed SMFrWF has also been modeled in a hardware description language (HDL) and implemented on an Artix-7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform to evaluate the hardware performance. We observed that the proposed SMFrWF has 65% lower energy consumption than the FrWF (both implemented on the same board). Thus, the proposed SMFrWF appears suitable for computing the wavelet transform coefficients of HR images on low-cost visual sensors and IoT platforms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924490","Ministry of Electronics and Information technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8744331","Discrete wavelet transform (DWT);low memory;low complexity;low-cost portable devices;visual sensors","Discrete wavelet transforms;Memory management;Random access memory;Visualization;Complexity theory","","15","","71","CCBY","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study examines the effect of sensor quality, quantity, and wind climatology on the accuracy of characterizing airborne emission sources for sensor network data. We consider a simulation domain with a point-source emission and virtual sensors evenly placed around the facility fence-line. A source characterization framework is introduced that consists of three parts: plume dispersion, sensor response, and Bayesian source inference. Two types of real-time sensors are considered as candidate sensors: point-scale sensors (PS) and line-integrated real-time sensors (LS). A parsimonious set of parameters, including sensor bias, noise, and detection limit, are used to describe sensor quality. Wind data are obtained from multiple geographic settings to represent typical wind conditions from inland and coastal regions. Overall, we find that LS offer superior performance of source characterization than PS, mainly due to their extended spatial coverage that leads to a large observational footprint. However, PS have some advantages over the LS for field deployment and cost. It was also found that the persistence and uncertainty of wind direction are critical for source characterization. Persistence of wind direction is shown to be negatively correlated with the performance of source characterization, such that places with more broadly varying wind direction can better utilize sensors on the fence-line, thus improving source characterization. However, uncertainties in wind direction data can severely affect source characterization, especially for the estimation of emission strength. Finally, it is shown that a trade-off between sensor quality and quantity exists under certain circumstances, such that a dense sensor network with relatively low-quality sensors (large sensor noise or low sensitivity) could outperform a sparse sensor network with high-quality sensors (small sensor noise or high sensitivity) for source characterization. This finding suggests that a relatively low-quality sensor network has the potential of being a cost-effective method for long-term air quality monitoring.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258506","air quality;sensor network;source inference;physical analytics","Monitoring;Mathematical model;Air quality;Pollution measurement;Uncertainty;Spatial resolution;Atmospheric measurements","","2","","35","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems require highly trustworthy data to guarantee accurate and timely decisions. However, in most of the cases, the IoT data becomes dubious during the transmission towards the cloud. Ensuring data provenance in such a heterogeneous multi-layered system is a critical security issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure data provenance framework for cloud-centric IoT network by utilizing the immutable, deterministic and public nature of the blockchain smart contracts with the traditional cloud infrastructure. In the framework, the cryptographic hash of the device metadata is stored in the blockchain whereas actual data is stored off-chain i.e., in the cloud, making it highly scalable for a dense deployment of IoT devices in the network. Multiple smart contracts are stationed in the blockchain to guarantee the provenance receipt to the data stored in the cloud.

In addition, we also develop an offloading simulator to generate dynamic offloading workload of multiple devices. With this toolkit, we study the effect of task acceleration in different cloud servers and analyze the capacity of several cloud servers to handle multiple concurrent requests. We conduct multiple experiments in a real testbed to evaluate the system and present our experiences and lessons learned. From the results, we find that the AutoScaler component introduces a very small overhead of ≈150 milliseconds in the total response time of a request, which is a fair price to pay to empower the offloading architectures with multi-tenancy ability and dynamic horizontal scaling for IoT scenarios.","","978-1-5090-4338-5","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917610","Edge Computing;Mobile Cloud;Cloudlet;IoT","Cloud computing;Servers;Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Computational modeling;Androids;Humanoid robots","","30","33","15","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2762828","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion through the Korea Government (MSIT) (Research on Communication Technology using Bio-Inspired Algorithm and 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World)(grant numbers:2013-0-00396); National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2015R1A-2A2A01006812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067440","Intrusion detection system;impersonation attack;deep learning;feature extraction;stacked autoencoder;large-scale Wi-Fi networks","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Support vector machines;Wireless networks;Computational modeling;Security;Machine learning","","154","","71","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) conveys a promising and brilliant future for this technology, particularly for vehicles with V2G capability, that will result in a boom in the pervasiveness of EVs in the next decades. Digitalization and modernization of power systems, as well as ever-growing technological advances in information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet of things (IoT), will procure a smart platform that facilitates peer-to-peer (P2P) communication of power systems’ elements. Thus, future power systems will be immensely complicated and interconnected in terms of data transfer and data processing. Hence, in addition to the employment of big data techniques, some structural changes are required to deal with such a massive body of data. Therefore, the security of data must be ensured specifically for financial transactions. Furthermore, in the future grids, millions of microsources will sell their generating power to the local loads in demand-side, and a load may be served by several microsources. Furthermore, flexible loads can use this platform to trade interchangeably with inelastic loads or the main grid. In this respect, myriad transactions must be recorded, which cannot be handled with the current banking system. This matter necessitates the deployment of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies for handling these microtransactions without needing to supervisory and authority. Hence, a proper platform is indispensable to connect the vendors and purchasers easily and executes the transaction after authentication, validation, and verification of both sides.

IoT applications remarkably benefit from deep learning (DL) based on neural networks. Considering edge nodes with the limited ability of processing, the small-scale compressive DL model is applicatively deployed into them. However, the model can expose the privacy of training dataset. Thus, the model should be regarded as confidential due to the sensitive training dataset when applied in commercial and security fields. In this paper, we design a deep-learning-based service provision system for protecting the privacy and enhancing services in edge computing. We propose a practical approach for building the private compressive DL model by incorporating differential privacy mechanism on the cloud server side. For protecting the privacy of training dataset, the approach is composed of the private dense training step and the private compressive training step, where differential privacy is used to construct the private pre-trained dense model and the private compressive model, respectively. The private compressive model with 1/9 of the dense model's size can be practically embedded into edge servers. Edge servers provide enhanced services to the near IoT devices. Finally, we mainly execute a set of experiments on MNIST dataset. Compared to the dense model with no privacy constraints and with differential privacy (train and test accuracies of 98.0% and 98.2%, 95.5%, and 97.2%, respectively), the private compressive model perturbation with (6, 10-5)-differential privacy (train and test accuracies of 96.3% and 95.8%) can achieve high utility while upholding tight privacy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927163","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0800601); Key Program of NSFC-Tongyong Union Foundation(grant numbers:U1636209); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602358); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756187","Compressive model;differential privacy;deep learning;edge computing","Training;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Internet of Things;Differential privacy;Privacy;Servers","","8","","48","CCBY","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We map the algorithm to a very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture based around an singleinstruction, multiple-data data path with hardware support to exploit data sparsity by completely eliding unnecessary computation and data movement. This approach exploits sparsity, without compromising the parallel computation. We also exploit the inherent algorithmic noise-tolerance of neural networks, by introducing circuit-level timing violation detection to allow worst case voltage guard-bands to be minimized. The resulting intermittent timing violations may result in logic errors, which conventionally need to be corrected. However, in lieu of explicit error correction, we cope with this by accentuating the noise tolerance of neural networks.

The cornerstone medium for promoting this autonomy is smart transformers made out of solid-state technology, which serve the dual role of a power-electronic transformer with very fast switching capability, and, hence, with significantly smaller size than conventional magnetic transformers, as well as of a powerful computer or logic-machine that can make intelligent decisions via communication. Solid-state transformers (SSTs) are, in fact, being anticipated to be the backbone of tomorrow's modern distribution grid. Microgrids typically have three layers of controllers - namely, primary control (for switching and circuit-breaking decisions), secondary control (for voltage and frequency regulation, and synchronization), and tertiary control (where a centralized supervisory controller communicates with energy management centers for updating setpoints according to load demands, and other changes in the circuit). Operating these control layers in today's microgrids require professional knowledge of the system, and calls for the operators to manually configure each of the components. With technology advancing to low-cost microprocessor driven devices such as SSTs, we propose a suite of new control and learning approaches that exploit different `Internet of things' functionalities embedded inside the SSTs, and thereby guarantee at-scale resilience, reliability, fault-tolerance, and autonomy for tomorrow's distribution networks.","","978-1-5090-2182-6","10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8062607","","Microgrids;Stability analysis;Voltage control;Load modeling;Control design","","3","","25","IEEE","9 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the human involvement in MCS results in a high possibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or intentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently undermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays a crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing a better quality of services while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this paper, a novel trust model called experience-reputation (E-R) is proposed for evaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in an MCS platform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are manipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data from such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called experience and reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the experience and reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between the users are established, evaluated, and maintained. Based on these trust relationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for selecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks. In order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed trust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several recruitment schemes in an MCS testbed, which consists of both normal and malicious users. The results highlight the strength of the trust-based scheme as it delivers a better quality for MCS services while being able to detect malicious users.

The ubiquitous visible light communication (VLC) technique has been seamlessly combined into the energy-efficient backscatter communication system, called the visible-light backscatter communication (VL-BackCom), for powering the massive number of IoT devices and prolonging their working-time. In the VL-BackCom system, the tag can modulate and backscatter the visible light signal (by switching the liquid crystal display (LCD) shutter) illuminated from light source to its nearby receiver. However, few work focuses on modeling and analyzing the performance of the large-scale VL-BackCom network. To this end, this paper makes the first attempt to model and investigate the network performance, namely the success VL-BackCom probability and network capacity, by borrowing the analytical tractable tool from stochastic geometry. The network topology is modeled using the analytical tractable generalized Gauss-Poisson process (GPP) under some justifiable assumptions, yielding a lower bound for practical VL-BackCom network with irregular deployment. The expressions of the success VL-BackCom probability and network capacity are clearly derived to characterize the VL-BackCom link's reliability as well as the spatial success transmission density, respectively. Moreover, the effects of backscatter parameters, say duty cycle and reflection coefficient, on network performance are also studied.","","978-1-7405-2390-5","10.23919/APCC.2017.8303983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303983","Backscatter communication;visible light;network modeling;performance analysis;stochastic geometry","Backscatter;Analytical models;Liquid crystal displays;Performance evaluation;Geometry;Network topology;Stochastic processes","","3","","16","","1 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new paradigm creates the opportunity for edge-enabled systems and applications, that have components executing directly and cooperatively on edge devices. Having systems' components, actively and directly, collaborating in the edge, requires some form of distributed monitoring as to adapt to variable operational conditions. Monitoring requires efficient ways to aggregate information collected from multiple devices.

In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management.

Therefore, there are many public places and private stores have started to provide free charging services. However, there are several issues that restrict the popularity of public charging service. First, people cannot easily find charging spots. Second, there is no effective way to monitor charging status and manage the chargers. Third, a free charging service increases business expenses. To address these issues, we developed a Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless charging service system, which is called AnyCharge. There are five major components of AnyCharge: 1) a Wi-Fi enabled wireless charger; 2) an IoT gateway; 3) a cloud-based management platform; 4) a secure Wi-Fi auto-connection algorithm; and 5) a mobile app. The charger is connected to an IoT gateway through Wi-Fi using our secure auto-connection algorithm, and the gateways are linked to the cloud server using message queue telemetry transport. The administrators can monitor and control chargers using the management platform. In addition, Android and iOS apps have been created to allow users to locate free chargers and find the shortest route to the nearest charging spot. We initiated a large-scale experimental deployment in Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, and Japan. More than 200 chargers have been installed in different places, including restaurants, hospitals, telecom stores, and hotels.

Three main contributions are provided. First, we present the design and prototype implementation of WuN nodes able to support two different energy-saving modes; such modes can be configured via software, and hence dynamically tuned. Second, we show by experimental measurements that the optimal policy strictly depends on the application requirements. Third, we move from the node design to the network design, and we devise proper orchestration algorithms which select both the optimal set of WuN to wake-up and the proper energy-saving mode for each WuN, so that the application lifetime is maximized, while the redundancy of correlated measurements is minimized.

Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was implemented to collect large-scale tobacco-related data sets from Facebook. This demonstrates that the proposed framework is feasible and reasonable. Our preliminary findings reveal that, first, tobacco-related content grows exponentially. In particular, the growth of the protobacco group follows the exponential law, whereas there is linear growth for the tobacco control group.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is widely used for exchanging information between clients and servers. The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the expansion/penetration of Internet access to new areas have resulted in the ever-rapidly increasing number of Internet users. Consequently, scalability has become one of the key requirements of modern web applications. One of the challenging problems of scalability is scaling out web-push applications since they are constrained by unshareable resources and their stateful nature. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud service provider that offers a variety of services. Web-push applications can leverage the services that AWS provides. Developers can build their entire service stack on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) if other services cannot fulfill their business requirements. To enable the scalability feature, a centralized message mediator is needed to orchestrate and coordinate messages across the web-push nodes. The publish-subscribe pattern should be implemented from upstream to downstream in order to optimize the flow of data. This paper examines the technologies that could be used as building blocks to create scalable web-push applications, and proposes three architectures using three different messaging services, i.e., Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), Redis Pub/Sub, and Apache ActiveMQ. A couple of push and pull models as well as an adaptive push/pull model are introduced and experimentally compared in this paper. The actor model, on account of its being a robust model, is used for handling concurrency and for coordinating the flow of messages between a messaging server and a web client. We created a chat room application to evaluate the architectures with different criteria and conditions, and the push technology used our experimentation was WebSocket. From our experiment, we found that Amazon SNS performed relatively poorly compare to the other two due to the overhead of web services calls. The architectures using Redis Pub/Sub and ActiveMQ performed equally well even though the ActiveMQ server took more time to process messages. We acknowledge that there are a large number of factors involved in and potentially affecting the performance, and that the response time is merely one of the properties that ought to be considered in making a design decision.","","978-1-5386-0610-0","10.1109/ICSEng.2017.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8121687","Push Technology;Real-Time Notification;Amazon Web Services;AWS;Publish-Subscribe;Amazon SNS;Redis;ActiveMQ;Push Model;Pull Model;WebSocket","Protocols;Servers;Publish-subscribe;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Data models","","1","","16","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the application of compressed sensing (CS)-based image compression and transmission in the field of IoMT, the traditional CS image reconstruction algorithms have been extended to model-based algorithms, which exploit more prior information of multimedia objects other than sparsity/compressibility in the reconstruction process. However, these algorithms mainly exploit just one type of prior information, still leaving room for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel CS image reconstruction algorithm by jointly leveraging multi-scale (local and global) heterogeneous (statistical and structural) priors of natural images, named jointly leveraging statistical and structural priors for CS image reconstruction (JLSSP-CS), to enable high-quality CS image recovery for IoMT. Specifically, the proposed JLSSP-CS algorithm is realized under the iterative hard thresholding framework, and the reconstruction process is composed of two phases. In the first phase, the local statistical correction and the global statistical correction are considered sequentially. Then, the global statistical and structural priors are exploited in nested iterations to further refine the recovery result in the second phase. The extensive simulations have been conducted, and the results indicate that the proposed JLSSP-CS algorithm outperforms the current state of the art by realizing high-quality image reconstruction with a small number of measurements for IoMT end devices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896653","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871147,61831008,91638204); Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:JCYJ20170811160142808,JCYJ20170811154309920); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8634005","Internet of Multimedia Things;compressed sensing;multi-scale heterogeneous priors;iterative hard thresholding;image reconstruction","Image reconstruction;Image coding;Sensors;Matching pursuit algorithms;Transforms;Internet of Things","","4","","36","OAPA","4 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the needs for interacting with the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT) were already partially addressed by the recent KNX Web Services application note, KNX IP networking still supports IPv4 only. This paper proposes the usage of IPv6 networking as native KNX medium. The most obvious approach of mapping the existing KNXnet/IP mechanisms from IPv4 to IPv6 is neglected, and more elaborate solutions to existing issues in KNXnet/IP networking are discussed. The main objective is a better utilization of IPv6 features for a possible KNX IPv6 architecture, resulting in increased performance and compatibility to standard Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networking. Therefore, several core design issues are raised and discussed in the course of this work. A transparent mapping approach between KNX and IPv6 addresses is proposed to facilitate the huge IPv6 address space. Further, the introduction of multi-homed Internet connectivity and node mobility by the usage of the Locator/ID Separator Protocol (LISP) is examined. Security considerations are addressed by comparing the upcoming KNX IP Secure standard to IPSec network layer security.

Dedicated server systems for cloud services, better capacity utilization and economies of scale because of the use of larger and more energy-efficient data centers are the reasons why cloud solutions typically use less energy than traditional on-premise systems. To scientifically and rationally configure the hardware and software resources of the cloud computing, the research on forecasting a cloud computing resource load becomes a research focus. However, the widely-used single forecasting model cannot contain all the characteristics of the cloud computing resource load sequence, resulting in inaccurate forecasting results. In this paper, a combined forecasting approach of cloud computing resource load based on wavelet decomposition is proposed, which combined the grey model and cubic exponential smoothing model. It can well preserve details and reduce noise. Firstly, the cloud computing resource load sequence is decomposed into several frequencies by the wavelet decomposition method. The decomposed load sequences with different characteristics are divided into different resolution scale subspaces in deferent frequencies. The noise of the load sequences is reduced by the wavelet threshold denoising method. And then, the load sequences are reconstructed according to the wavelet coefficients. The reconstructed load sequence not only contains less noise but also reserves detailed information. Consequently, it is closer to the real data and more regular. Experimental results show that our proposed combined forecasting model with wavelet decomposition can provide more accurate forecasting results than each single forecasting model or the combined forecasting model without using the wavelet decomposition method. Thus, our proposal is demonstrated to be efficient for forecasting the cloud computing resource load and helping to reduce energy consumption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945046","Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2019JM-162,2019KRM021); Xi'an University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2019QDJ007); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP18K18044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854996","Cloud computing resource load;wavelet decomposition;combined forecasting model;grey model;cubic exponential smoothing model","Forecasting;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Load modeling;Predictive models;Energy efficiency;Data centers","","15","","31","CCBY","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to an IBS report, the cost of developing a System on Chip (SoC) at 14nm may be as high as $300 million [1]. The economics of semiconductor IC development favors high volume production, while high volume cannot be attained without developing an IC that serves a large number of applications. Some of these applications are in low margin Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where an SoC cannot command a high price. Consequently, without the ability to customize IC features after production, the price of an IC will be determined by its lowest priced application. This motivates the manufacturers to develop capabilities for post-production IC customization. The commodity microprocessor business offers an example of post-production customization, where a manufacturer can tailor cache size, number of cores and frequency of operation for a target market segment after a chip has been manufactured. Today, such customization is limited to one-time programming (OTP) for predetermined IC bins. In this paper, we explore how an IC can be programmed repeatedly and securely using a blockchain-based smart contract. This will enable users to upgrade IC features, or rent upgraded IC features for a fixed period after it has been purchased. The availability of such a system could, for example, allow a buyer to upgrade her processor from i3 to i5 after it has been purchased to scale to her computing needs in exchange of a payment made to the manufacturer. IC feature configuration is implemented by firmware updates from the manufacturer. The smart contract takes the feature configuration request from the IC as input and outputs the source of corresponding firmware. To support remote and authorized update by manufacturer, we propose an on-die hardware module that communicates with the smart contract and enforces its functionalities. Availability of this module also facilitates secure firmware update. The blockchain makes the update protocol secure and prevents users from obtaining unauthorized update.","","978-1-7281-4693-5","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946178","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Firmware Update;Chip Features;Internet of Things","Integrated circuits;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Hardware;Authentication;Microprogramming","","6","","19","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inference is typically based on data collected with wearable sensors or those embedded in the environment. A major obstacle in large-scale utilization of these systems is that the computational algorithms cannot be shared between users or reused in contexts different than the setting in which the training data are collected. For example, an activity recognition algorithm trained for a wrist-band sensor cannot be used on a smartphone worn on the waist. We propose an approach for automatic detection of physical sensor-contexts (e.g., on-body sensor location) without need for collecting new labeled training data. Our techniques enable system designers and end-users to share and reuse computational algorithms that are trained under different contexts and data collection settings. We develop a framework to autonomously identify sensor-context. We propose a gating function to automatically activate the most accurate computational algorithm among a set of shared expert models. Our analysis based on real data collected with human subjects while performing 12 physical activities demonstrate that the accuracy of our multi-view learning is only 7.9% less than the experimental upper bound for activity recognition using a dynamic sensor constantly migrating from one on-body location to another.

One of the most crucial development areas addresses the aggregation of massive amounts of sensor data arriving continuously from a wide variety of hardware components: e.g. tyre sensors, cameras built on-board, and other external sources. Since the main aim of the manufacturers is to build safer, easier to drive, and more autonomous cars based on the collected data; they follow the latest ICT trends. Two technologies can be considered as already accepted and proven approaches at several application fields since they provide facilities (among others) to handle and process the generated, heterogeneous, large-scale, and rapidly growing data sets: Cloud computing and big data. The cloud infrastructure may act as an Internet of Things (IoT) backend, or as a kind of central hub by gathering the incoming sensor and other types of data. Moreover, the cloud offers elasticity in terms of data analytics and distribution services for such enormous amount of data. This paper details the second, private Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) version of our cloud-oriented IoT back-end framework for Connected Cars and its scalable services relying on our experiences gained during the development of its first, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) variant on an OpenNebula infrastructure. During the design and development stages we leveraged on the Cloud Foundry PaaS platform deployed at the premises of an automotive supplier company. The new reference implementation is able to handle, analyze and visualize vehicular data as illustrated by various use cases including Eco-driving, weather report/forecast, parameter coding over cloud, collection of CAN data, flashing devices remotely, etc.","","978-1-5386-7413-0","10.1109/SNSP.2018.00085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8615963","Connected Cars;IoT;cloud;Platform-as-a-Service;vehicular data handling","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Databases;Connected vehicles;Servers;Foundries;Protocols","","6","","19","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More and more users and organizations are increasingly relying on cloud storage services for data management. In such Internet enabled environments, protecting sensitive data is increasingly becoming very crucial. Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) based approaches have been recognized as very promising for data protection in such environments. ABE approaches support data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in Internet-based environments, which include Internet of things (IoTs) and a plethora of heterogeneous mobile devices that enable large scale applications. However, in IoTs and mobile applications the limited computational resources and finite battery power of devices make it very difficult to use ABE schemes because of their heavy computational requirements. Although outsourced computational techniques have been applied in partial ABE schemes to address such issues, a unified platform that supports all aspects of data protection in an Internet-based open environment as well as fast cryptographic operations and decentralized authorities, etc., is still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel Attribute Based Encryption as a Service (ABEaaS) that can be leveraged for data protection in the Internet environments. We propose an ABEaaS framework that can be easily deployed and present related security and performance analysis.","","978-1-5090-4607-2","10.1109/CIC.2016.061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809732","Internet Service;Cloud Computing;Data Access Control;Attribute Based Encryption;Cloud Storage Service","Encryption;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Mobile handsets;Access control","","1","","17","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we model the dense cellular M2M communication system using a Ginibre determinant point process and study the corresponding green communication metrics, including grid energy consumption and grid energy efficiency (EE). A dedicated millimeter-wave-based hybrid energy harvesting (EH) mechanism is proposed to maintain self-sustainable communication. Two EH modes are discussed, of which Mode 1 is suitable for long-term operation, while Mode 2 is preferred in dealing with a temporary energy shortage. We first minimize the average grid energy consumption by solving a large-scale linear programming problem. When the battery at machine device is charged with sufficient energy at the initial time, closed-form formula describing the average grid energy consumption of both the modes can be derived under moderate throughput constraints, which is proved to have clear relationship with 1) initial battery energy level at machine gateway and machine device; 2) specific hybrid EH time-division strategy; 3) system operation time; and 4) static power consumption at machine gateway and machine device. The numerical solutions are obtained using the interior-point method, and the results are illustrated and discussed. When dealing with the originally non-convex EE maximization problem, we first transform it into a series of sub-problems using the successive convex approximation method and then iteratively solve them with a trick combining Taylor expansion and square error minimization. Non-orthogonal multi-access (NOMA) transmission is investigated in our model to further improve the EE performance.

It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030491","","Smart devices;Computer architecture;Scalability;Metadata;Performance evaluation;Software defined networking;Network architecture","","311","6","15","IEEE","8 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A key technique to guard the secure and safe operation of connected embedded devices is remote attestation. It allows a third party, the verifier, to ensure the integrity of a remote device, the prover. Unfortunately, existing attestation protocols are impractical when applied in autonomous networks of embedded systems due to their limited scalability, performance, robustness, and security guarantees. In this work, we propose PASTA, a novel attestation protocol that is particularly suited for autonomous embedded systems. PASTA is the first that (i) enables many low-end prover devices to attest their integrity towards many potentially untrustworthy low-end verifier devices, (ii) is fully decentralized, thus, able to withstand network disruptions and arbitrary device outages, and (iii) is in addition to software attacks capable of detecting physical attacks in a much more robust way than any existing protocol. We implemented our protocol, conducted measurements, and simulated large networks. The results show that PASTA is practical on low-end embedded devices, scales to large networks with millions of devices, and improves robustness by multiple orders of magnitude compared with the best existing protocols.","","978-1-7281-1148-3","10.1109/EuroSP.2019.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8806746","remote attestation;collective attestation;embedded system;mesh networks;autonomous system","Protocols;Security;Robustness;Scalability;Embedded systems;Performance evaluation","","7","","48","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clustering, a popular data mining technique, aims to identify underlying patterns hidden in the data. Most clustering methods assume the static data, thus they are unfavorable for analyzing large, unbalanced dynamic data. In this paper, to address this concern, we focus on incremental clustering by extending the novel [clustering by fast search (CFS) and find of density peaks] method to incrementally handle large-scale dynamic data. Specifically, we first discuss two challenges, i.e., assignment of new arriving objects and dynamic adjustment of clusters, in incremental CFS (ICFS) clustering. We then propose two ICFS clustering algorithms, ICFS with multiple representatives (ICFSMR) and the enhanced ICFSMR (E_ICFSMR) to tackle the two challenges. In ICFSMR, we explore the convex hull theory to modify the representatives identified for each cluster. E_ICFSMR improves the generality and effectiveness of ICFSMR by exploring one-time cluster adjustment strategy after integration of each data chunk. We evaluate the proposed methods with extensive experiments on four benchmark data sets, as well as the air quality and traffic monitoring time series, with comparisons to CFS and other three state-of-the-art incremental clustering methods.

An application scenario is a Smart City in which the city infrastructure, cars, and people exchange information to enable new services. IP protocols, such as IPv6, TCP and HTTP will be further complemented by IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks and Constrained Application Protocol currently in development in IETF. Security and privacy are a must for the IP-based IoTs in order to ensure its acceptance. However, mobility, limited bandwidth, and resource-constrained devices pose new challenges and require for a sound and efficient security architecture. In particular, dynamic association of mobile smart objects and the management of keys in large-scale networks remain an open challenge. In this context, we propose a flexible security architecture based on the Host Identity Protocol and Multimedia Internet KEYing protocols allowing for secure network association and key management. HIP - based on asymmetric-key cryptography - ensures unambiguous thing identification, mobility support, as well as a lightweight and secure method for network association. In our solution, HIP is extended with MIKEY capabilities to provide enhanced key management using polynomials, which allow to generate pair wise keys with any node based on its identity. This combination of protocols and crypto-algorithms ensures both strong security and very good performance as shown by our implementation and presents clear advantages compared with other alternatives.","","978-0-7695-4952-1","10.1109/WAINA.2013.158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550580","Internet of Things;Security;Network Access;Key management","Protocols;Hip;Cryptography;Polynomials;IP networks;Prototypes","","11","","17","IEEE","1 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ongoing cryptographic contests and standardization efforts evaluate lightweight block ciphers on their resistance to power analysis side channel attack (SCA), and the ability to apply countermeasures. While some ciphers have been individually evaluated, a large scale comparison of resistance to side channel attack and formulation of the relative cost of implementing countermeasures is difficult, since researchers typically use varied architectures, optimization strategies, technologies, and evaluation techniques. In this research we leverage the t-test leakage detection methodology and an open-source side channel analysis suite (FOBOS) to compare FPGA implementations of AES, SIMON, SPECK, PRESENT, LED, and TWINE, using a choice of architecture targeted to optimize throughput-to-area (TP/A) ratio, for resistance to differential power analysis (DPA). We then apply an equivalent level of protection to the above ciphers using 3-share threshold implementations (TI), and verify improved resistance to DPA. We find that SIMON has the highest TP/A ratio of protected versions, followed by PRESENT, TWINE, LED, AES, and SPECK.

Though more resources in the cloud may be allocated to alleviate such overloading issues, this research proposes the alternative of utilizing Fog computing to extend the scalability of IoT/M2M platforms in the cloud. The Fog is used not only to offload the over congested cloud but also to provide low latency required by critical applications. Our first step is to migrate oneM2M, a global IoT/M2M platform, to a Fog computing architecture in which the middle nodes of oneM2M are organized into a highly scalable hierarchical container-based Fog nodes. We then design a mechanism to dynamically scale in/out the serving instances of the middle nodes in order to make the whole IoT/M2M platform more scalable. The paper illustrates our system design and demonstrates our system scalability capacity using an industrial IoT (IIoT) use case. Finally, we compare the performance of our dynamic scaling mechanism with those based on a static and fixed pool of serving instances.","","978-1-4673-9944-9","10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355143","Scalability;Fog Computing;oneM2M;IoT;M2M;IIoT;container","Cloud computing;Radiofrequency identification;Scalability;Computer architecture;Edge computing;Containers","","18","","10","IEEE","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We employ a noncoherent maximum-likelihood (ML) detector at the receiver side which does not need the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). For such a massive SIMO system, we present a new design framework to assure that each transmitted signal matrix can be uniquely determined in the noise-free case and be reliably estimated in noisy cases. The key idea is to utilize a new concept called the uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG) based on the practically used quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation. To improve the average error performance when the antenna array size is scaled up, we propose a max-min Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance design by carrying out optimization over the transmitted power and the sub-constellation assignment. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed design outperforms significantly the existing max-min Euclidean distance based method in terms of error performance.

One of the most recent business realization of NRS implementation on large scale distributed systems (such as Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain) is to ensure visibility and traceability of the object throughout the chain. However, this requires assurance of security and privacy to ensure lawful business operation. In this paper, we are proposing a secure tracker protocol that will ensure not only visibility and traceability of the object but also genuineness of the object and its travel path on-site. The proposed protocol is using Physically Unclonable Function (PUF), Diffie-Hellman algorithm and simple cryptographic primitives to protect privacy of the partners, injection of fake objects, non-repudiation, and unclonability. The tag only performs a simple mathematical computation (such as combination, PUF and division) that makes the proposed protocol suitable to passive tags. To verify our security claims, we performed experiment on Security Protocol Description Language (SPDL) model of the proposed protocol using automated claim verification tool Scyther. Our experiment not only verified our claims but also helped us to eliminate possible attacks identified by Scyther.","","978-1-4799-8676-7","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176190","PUF;unclonable;tracker;protocol;NRS;RFID;privacy;injection of fake objects;non-repudiation;IoT","Protocols;Security;Mathematical model;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Privacy","","11","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) phrase table pruning method for pivot-based statistical machine translation (SMT). The SMT system requires a great amount of bilingual data to build a high-performance translation model. For some language pairs, such as Chinese-English, massive bilingual data are available on the web. However, for most language pairs, large-scale bilingual data are hard to obtain. Pivot-based SMT is proposed to solve the data scarcity problem: it introduces a pivot language to bridge the source language and the target language. Therefore, a source-target translation model based on well-trained source-pivot and pivot-target translation models can be derived with the pivot-based approach. However, due to the ambiguities of the pivot language, source and target phrases with different meanings may be wrongly matched. Consequently, the derived source-target phrase table may contain incorrect phrase pairs. To alleviate this problem, we apply the MBR method to prune the phrase table. The MBR pruning method removes the phrase pairs with the lowest risk from the phrase table. Experimental results on Europarl data show that the proposed method can both reduce the size of phrase tables and improve the performance of translations.

This work investigates issues in large-scale computer networks related to the deployment of low- and very-low resource miniaturized nodes integrated within materials. These networks operate under harsh conditions with possibility of technical failures requiring robustness. Despite sensor networks used for structural monitoring, self-adaptive materials can profit from self-organizing and autonomous distributed data processing using Multi-agent systems, demonstrated in this paper. Self-adaptive materials are able to adapt the material or mechanical structure properties based on their environmental interaction (load/stress) to minimize the risk of overloading. A structure that could change its local properties in service based on the identified loading situation could thus potentially raise additional weight saving potentials and thus supporting lightweight design, and in consequence, sustainability.","","978-1-5090-6558-5","10.1109/FAS-W.2017.123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8064099","Big Data;Pervasive Computing;Material Computing;Adaptive Materials;Agents;Self-organizing systems","Data processing;Stress;Loading;Robot sensing systems;Conferences;Monitoring","","2","","23","IEEE","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The heterogeneous and dynamic nature of smart objects that will form the IoT requires the design and adoption of standard communication models and protocols in order to enable interoperability and long-term evolution of deployed systems. Much attention must be therefore paid on the adoption of lightweight and low-overhead communications intended to minimize energy- consumption and processing load. While the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is intended to bring the REST paradigm to smart objects, there are many application scenarios that might benefit from the use of sessions (i.e., an exchange of data between an association of participants). In this paper, we introduce a lightweight Session Initiation Protocol targeted to constrained environments, based on CoAP, which re-uses the syntax and semantics of CoAP in order to create, modify, and terminate sessions among smart objects with minimal overhead.","","978-1-4799-5952-5","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417242","","Servers;Standards;Internet of things;Semantics;Transport protocols","","1","","13","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper aims to calculate the spectrum which is required for IoT services in case of Jakarta Smart City. We use the method of forecasting IoT connected devices then predict the spectrum need with two scenarios. In this paper, we defined 2 scenarios, i.e. scenario 1 needs 15-20 uSec (includes over head time) on data rates 50 Kbps. Meanwhile, scenario 2 needs 8-11 uSec on data rates 100 Kbps. On 2025, IoT spectrum requirement in case of Jakarta Smart City will grow 17.27%. Regarding to the spectrum need, our work also proposes an IoT model for Jakarta Smart City applications, i.e. one-stop integrated service, UKM portal, e-health apps, e-integrated transport, waste management system, energy management system and integrated environmental information system.

This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead.

We consider that high reliability, i.e., that send operations reach close to 100% of live destination nodes, is a critical property for communication frameworks on edge networks. But reliability is difficult to achieve in a scalable way on edge networks because of the network's dynamicity, i.e., frequent node failures and partitioning. For example, both Internet of Things networks and mobile phone networks consist of devices that are often offline. To achieve reliability, our framework is based on two hybrid gossip algorithms, namely HyParView and Plumtree. Hybrid gossip algorithms combine gossip with other distributed algorithms to achieve both efficiency and high resilience.

Due to large deployments of small scale smart sensors in WBSNs, security, and privacy guarantees (e.g., security and safety-critical data, sensitive private information) are becoming a challenging issue because these sensor nodes communicate using an open channel, i.e., Internet. We implement data integrity (to resist against malicious tampering) using the secure hash algorithm 3 (SHA-3) when smart sensors in WBSNs communicate with each other using the Internet. Due to the limited resources (i.e., storage, computation, and communication capabilities) of sensors in WBSNs, a lightweight implementation of SHA-3 is needed. To address this challenge, we propose a new implementation of the SHA-3, which has a compact hardware architecture. Our implementation of SHA-3 consists of a reliable logic structure, random access memory, and an enhanced finite state machine. The simulation on a Vitrtex-5 field programmable gate array shows that the proposed implementation is suitable for the WBSN on different applications.

Recognizing and forecasting the underlying high-level states from raw sensory data are useful for daily activity recognition of humans and predictive maintenance of machines. Deep Learning (DL) methods have been proved efficient in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, and these model are also applied to time series analysis. Since time series are multi-dimensional and sequential with long-term temporal dependency, current DL-based model could not well learn the spatial and temporal features inside and between states, thus there is still plenty of room for improvement of recognizing and predicting high-level states. In this paper, a hybrid deep architecture named Long-term Recurrent Convolutional LSTM Network (LR-ConvLSTM) is proposed. The model is composed of Convolutional LSTM layers to extract features inside a high-level state, and extra LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies between high-level states. We evaluate our model on the Opportunity dataset that has once been used in public activity recognition challenge.

In this work, we carefully study detailed power and energy characteristics of Piton, a 25-core modern open source academic processor, including voltage versus frequency scaling, energy per instruction (EPI), memory system energy, network-on-chip (NoC) energy, thermal characteristics, and application performance and power consumption.

The open source nature of the processor provides increased value, enabling detailed characterization verified against simulation and the ability to correlate results with the design and register transfer level (RTL) model.

Currently, software-defined network (SDN) is considered a viable alternative that improves network scalability and management. Earlier in 2018, we designed a novel software-defined quadcopter (SDQ) with a mobile Internet of Things vehicle to measure the best efficient wind power location for effective future wind turbine placement. However, large wind farms require complex and scalable wind measurement platform that consists of multiple quadcopters and ground mobile nodes that operate under a decision-making softwarized protocol. To this end, this paper proposes a novel cognitive routing protocol called SDQ interdomain management (SDQIM) Protocol. The SDQIM structure consists of multiple SDN controllers with failover capability. Our proposed protocol operate with multiple phases as each phase is used to cover a specific scenario that could occur in the interdomain network. The SDQ-main will have a total overview of the network topology and the SDQ-slave will be responsible for communication management with all other local subdomains. However, for large-scale farmland, quadcopter power level is essential for the continuity of the system services. Thus, we additionally propose a decentralized inductive power transfer (DIPT) platform that operates autonomously using software defined controlling approach. In essence, The DIPT platform is considered to be automated and low-cost approach that encompasses a custom-designed SDN controller for all interdomain quadcopters. Our system has been implemented by using an experimental testbed. The experimental results showed that scalability of the SDQ system can be increased to cover large wind farms with uninterrupted power management platform.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2882897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8543153","Cognitive routing;decentralized inductive power transfer (DIPT);Internet of Things (IoT);power management;software-defined network (SDN);software-defined quadcopter (SDQ)","Protocols;Wind turbines;Internet of Things;Wind speed;Current measurement;Power measurement","","","","17","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel time series framework (TSF) to model and forecast timescale network traffic dynamics in M2M communications that is capable of providing useful guidance for effective NRP. Specifically, our TSF utilizes the statistical techniques INGARCH(p,q) (integer valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) and βARMA(p,q) (beta autoregressive moving average) to accurately capture both the internal and external impact factors of the asynchronous and synchronous M2M traffic dynamics over a large time scale, and produces forecasts for multiple upcoming time points by leveraging conditional maximum-likelihood estimators (CMLE). Through a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, we have validated the modeling and forecasting efficacy of TSF.

In this project, we propose a new authentication mechanism based on a specific implementation of PUF using metallic dendrites. Dendrites are nanomaterial devices that contain unique, complex and unclonable patterns (similar to human DNAs). We propose a method to process dendrite images. The proposed framework comprises several steps including denoising, skeletonizing, pruning and feature points extraction. The feature points are represented in terms of a tree-based weighted algorithm that converts the authentication problem to a graph matching problem. The test object is compared against a database of valid patterns using a novel algorithm to perform user identification and authentication. The proposed method demonstrates a high level of accuracy and a low computational complexity that grows linearly with the number of extracted points and database size. It also significantly reduces the required in-network storage capacity and communication rates to maintain database of users in large-scale networks.","","978-1-5090-5443-5","10.1109/SAI.2017.8252196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252196","Information-Security;Image-Processing;Graph-Matching;Authentication","Authentication;Feature extraction;Skeleton;Robustness;Databases;Computational complexity","","2","","21","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conduct an at-scale study of more than five million projects on GitHub to reveal collaboration's effects on the popularity of software systems and speed of development. We find that having more collaborators results in higher popularity but slower development. Projects that use Objective-C are at an even more significant risk for lower development speeds than other projects. We define collaboration networks and co-commit networks, which capture the projects' collaboration patterns and use structural features of these networks to identify files within commits with bugs.

Consensus has been studied and applied extensively in diverse areas including control systems, optimization, distributed computing, and emerging areas such as robotics, Blockchain, and Internet-of-Things. However, one common issue in practical systems is the misuse of consensus algorithms that are impossible to achieve in asynchronous systems with failures. We propose an alternative formulation that is achievable in such a scenario and easy to understand compared to other versions of relaxed consensus formulation. Concretely, inspired by the asymptotic (approximate) consensus in control systems and applications in storage systems, we introduce a new consensus problem - Eventual Consensus (or Asymptotic Exact Consensus). Two distinctive features are “exact agreement“ and “eventual agreement“ on the state values of fault-free nodes. Eventual property allows us to solve the problem in asynchronous systems with crash or even Byzantine failures. Exact agreement property makes it useful for applications like storage systems which require replicas (or servers) to reach exactly the same state (eventually). Followed by the definition, we explain how eventual consensus is different from prior problems and how it might reduce the misuse by non-experts and practitioners. We then present simple algorithms to solve eventual consensus in static and dynamic systems. Finally, we provide two applications in distributed storage systems and Blockchain.","","978-1-7281-3151-1","10.1109/ALLERTON.2019.8919675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919675","Consensus;Fault-tolerance;Blockchain;Storage;Eventual Consensus;Asymptotic Consensus","Approximation algorithms;Convergence;Control systems;Distributed computing;Heuristic algorithms;Computer crashes","","","","42","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The missing objects, therefore, can be identified by the readers in the RFID system. Most of prior missing tag identification protocols consider the ideal scenario that all the tags' IDs are known to the reader, which ignore that some tags with unknown IDs, called unknown tags, may be present in the system.

Every device in this network is a cyber physical system that can independently get commands, do operations, move in the space, and it becomes possible to manage it remotely. For its security sensitivity, this ITC system is required to be protected with an adequate and effective intrusion detection mechanism. Traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to solve this issue become unhelpful for their computational constrains for big data processing and lack of comprehensive training datasets.

Many technologies have emerged accordingly to support their development. One of prominent technologies is Data Distribution Service (DDS) which is a publish-subscribe middleware standard that aims at improving the scalability and communication aspects in distributed and large-scale applications. DDS has been gaining increasing attentions due to its support for scalability and various quality of service (QoS) policies which are important for reliable communication. The DDS standard provides static and dynamic models of DDS entities. However, the dynamic models absent some important behaviors that are often assumed well understood, but have distinct semantics for which without their definitions, the dynamic models are left incomplete. Consequently, their absence hinders the understanding of DDS behaviors and their implementation. In this work, we define absent functional behaviors in DDS dynamic models including defining new operations that are necessary to complete the intended behaviors. We use the Object Constraint Language (OCL) to define the semantics of new operations.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397656","","Unified modeling language;Quality of service;Publish-subscribe;Reliability;Semantics;Real-time systems;Standards","","5","","14","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exponential increase in the number of diverse devices has resulted in a significant increase in the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of data (i.e., big data). These data present a large requirement on modern storage systems both for capacity and scale, and energy cost has become a critical problem. For storage clusters, much research effort has been invested in alleviating this problem by providing suitable resource capacity (i.e., on-demand providing). However, it is challenging to match the offered resource capacity with the real system workloads, thus resulting in a violation of service level agreement. By considering a storage cluster as a queueing system, this paper proposes a QoS-oriented capacity provisioning mechanism. Based on workload features, the mechanism models the pattern of current workloads as a suitable queueing model. In accordance with the model, our mechanism can well forecast the actual resource capacity demand without violating the service level agreement, and then offer the required resource capacity in terms of the real workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the energy consumption of a typical storage cluster, while meeting the QoS requirements. It also significantly outperforms two classic and two state-of-the-art capacity provisioning mechanisms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767703","NSFC(grant numbers:61572232,61272073); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201604016100); Science and Technology Planning Project of Nansha(grant numbers:2016CX007); Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Computer System and Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:CARCH201401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090525","IoT;energy efficient;energy saving;storage cluster;capacity demand estimation;capacity provisioning;QoS;SLA","Servers;Quality of service;Clustering algorithms;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Power demand","","5","","28","OAPA","31 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing works mainly studied offloading which type of computing tasks into FNs, but few studies enabled smart resource partitioning of FNs. In this paper, a service popularity-based smart resources partitioning (SPSRP) scheme is proposed for fog computing-enabled IIoT.

Besides, a mobility and heterogeneity-aware partitioning algorithm is presented for extending SPSRP scheme to seamlessly support cross-domain resources partitioning.

Serverless computing originally emerged as a Cloud computing framework, but might be a perfect match for IoT data processing at the Edge. However, the existing serverless solutions, based on VMs and containers, are too heavy-weight (large memory footprint and high function invocation time) for operating efficiency and elastic scaling at the Edge. Moreover, many novel IoT applications require low-latency data processing and near real-time responses, which makes the current cloud-based serverless solutions unsuitable. Recently, WebAssembly (Wasm) has been proposed as an alternative method for running serverless applications at near-native speeds, while having a small memory footprint and optimized invocation time. In this paper, we discuss some existing serverless solutions, their design details, and unresolved performance challenges for an efficient serverless management at the Edge. We outline our serverless framework, called aWsm, based on the WebAssembly approach, and discuss the opportunities enabled by the aWsm design, including function profiling and SLO-driven performance management of users' functions. Finally, we present an initial assessment of aWsm performance featuring average startup time (12μs to 30μs) and an economical memory footprint (ranging from 10s to 100s of kB) for a subset of MiBench microbenchmarks used as functions.","2575-8462","978-1-7281-4222-7","10.1109/SRDS47363.2019.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9049531","Cloud computing, Serverless, FaaS, IoT, Edge computing, WebAssembly, Wasm, performance management, SLOs.","Containers;Cloud computing;Libraries;Runtime;Hardware;Virtual machine monitors;Internet of Things","","41","","38","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent based approaches. We analyze the convergence rate of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best trade-off between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments with real datasets, both on a networked prototype system and in a larger-scale simulated environment.

This shortcoming becomes critical when we consider the need for data sharing in many application domains; and it becomes significant when we consider the super huge scale of the IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud infrastructure and the dynamic data flows in the infrastructure. In this paper, we develop the solutions for IoT data management in the IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud infrastructure. We focus on the issues of data storage, specification and discovery.

We have applied DS-ontology to TSDBs and developed the SE-TSDB tool suite, which runs on top of existing TSDBs to help establish semantic specifications for data streams and enable semantic-based data retrievals. We have also developed the IoT data discovery techniques based on SE-TSDB to facilitate semantic based data retrieval in the IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud infrastructure.

Most farmers cultivate their crops based on their experience; therefore, pesticide over-spraying and over-fertilization often occur. In addition, stock farming with enterprise management strategies sometimes leads to antibiotic or other harmful chemical residuals on the carcass of animals and poultry due to improper food additives in fodders, thus causing food security problems. Recently, due to the emerging of agricultural product security problems, consumers are paying more and more attention to food safety. To achieve the goal of sustainable agriculture, the government in Taiwan has established a product traceability system. With the traceable marks, all agricultural products' information can be inquired through farmers' records on the production and sales via the Taiwan agricultural products security traceability information network. On behalf of the government, certified organizations come to the production site to confirm whether the production records are in compliance with the requirements. These certified organizations inspect agricultural products by sampling the products, and every inspected batch will be recorded and made traceable under the supervision. Currently, Taiwan has been promoting the agricultural product traceability system, and hopes that farmers will use the system voluntarily. However, since no mandatory requirements have been imposed, many farmers do not use the product traceability system. Moreover, the traceability system itself may cause inconveniences that prevent it from being accepted by all farmers. For example, farmers must prepare cultivation records and upload the records to a specified website established by the Council of Agriculture. This might run into two problems. First, most farmers are elderly citizens, and it might be difficult to teach them to use computers. Second, the product traceability records are created through manual inputs, the correctness cannot be ensured. Therefore, the study develops a farm production traceability system bases on the technology of Internet of Things that enables the system itself to create real-time production records and farmers can concentrate on their cultivation work.","2156-8073","978-1-5090-6526-4","10.1109/ICSensT.2017.8304449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8304449","Food safety;traceability system;Internet of things","Production;Radiofrequency identification;Agricultural products;Information systems;Animals;Databases","","2","","19","IEEE","1 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To deal with the dimension disaster problem faced by most conventional mining algorithms, in this paper we combine granulation techniques and genetic algorithm (GA) with a support vector machine (SVM) to propose a granular GA-SVM. In the integrated predictor, three granulation methods, that is, Min-Median-Max granulation, Quartile-Median granulation, and fuzzy granulation, are introduced to break down big data in agricultural cyber-physical systems into small-scale granules, and GA is used to find the optimal values of SVM penalty parameter and kernel parameter from the reduced granules. Internet of Things (IoT) data from Luochuan Apple Experimental Demonstration Station in Shaanxi Province, China, verified that the proposed granular GA-SVM predictor is effective to make big data prediction with reduced computation time and equivalent accuracy.

The convergence of both technologies stimulated innovations in both fields, we refer to this convergence as the Cloud of Things. The Cloud of Things enables users to request a complex IoT service (IoT application composed of several interconnected micro services) and deploy it seamlessly. However, deploying a complex IoT service in the Cloud of Things infrastructure is a difficult process due to the different types of physical nodes (Cloud data centers, IoT devices, gateways, etc.) and multiple architectures to collect and process data. Furthermore, network usage largely depends on the placement of different services across the network.

The plan of AP placement needs to be generated automatically by algorithms, especially for large-scale indoor environment. This paper presents an indoor map system that provides coordinate system and graphic representation. The detailed map information such as walls can be explicitly expressed and used to assist the AP placement algorithm. In this paper, AP placement is formulated into an optimization problem in which the sum of Euclidean distance of fingerprints among all the reference points (RPs) is maximized. The fingerprint at RP is predicted by an indoor radio propagation model which takes the attenuation of walls into consideration with the assistance of our indoor map. The optimization problem is solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and evaluated by k-nearest neighbors positioning algorithm in a real-world environment.

With these rapid enhancements, the scale and complexity of systems providing cloud computing services have also increased tremendously. The major challenge faced by cloud service providers today is to provide an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable solution for seamless delivery of services to users. To achieve this research community is constantly working hard on different related issues like scheduling, power consumption, high availability, customer retention, resource provisioning, reliability and minimizing the probability of failures, etc. Reliability of service is an important parameter. With a large number of components in the cloud, the probability of failures is becoming a norm rather than an exception while delivering services to users. This emphasizes the need to develop fault tolerant schemes for cloud environment to deliver the required level of reliability. In this work, we have proposed a novel fault detection and mitigation approach. The novelty of approach lies in the method of detecting the fault based on running status of the job. The detection algorithm periodically monitors the progress of job on virtual machines (VMs) and reports the stalled job due to failed VM to fault tolerant manager (FTM). This not only reduces the resources wastage but ensures timely delivery of services to avoid any penalty due to service level agreement (SLA) violation. The validation of the proposed approach is done using CloudSim simulator. The performance analysis reveals the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","978-1-5090-6218-8","10.1109/CIACT.2017.7977362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7977362","Fault Tolerance (FT);Injection;Detection and Mitigation","Cloud computing;Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Fault detection;Computational modeling","","14","","30","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent research works in deep learning have shown that autoencoder neural networks have a great capability in analyzing high-dimensional data and can be used for the purpose of anomaly detection in a supervised or unsupervised way, as anomaly labeled data are typically not available.

In this paper, we present a new approach that can efficiently classify crashes based on their exploitability, which facilitates the human analysts to prioritize the crashes to be examined and hence accelerate the discovery of vulnerabilities. A compact fingerprint for the dynamic execution trace of each crashing input is firstly generated based on n-gram analysis and feature hashing. The fingerprints are then fed to an online classifier to build the distinguishing model. The incremental learning enabled by the online classifier makes the built model scale well even for a large amount of crashes and at the same time easy to be updated for new crashes.

Demand Response (DR) has been identified as a key enabler of integrating these, and other, Smart Grid technologies, while, simultaneously, ensuring grid stability and secure energy supply. The massive deployment of smart meters, IoT devices and DERs dictate the need to move to decentralized, or even localized, DR schemes in the face of the increased scale and complexity of monitoring and coordinating the actors and devices in modern smart grids. Furthermore, there is an inherent need to guarantee interoperability, due to the vast number of, e.g., hardware and software stakeholders, and, more importantly, promote trust and incentivize the participation of customers in DR schemes, if they are to be successfully deployed.In this work, we illustrate the design of an energy system that addresses all of the roadblocks that hinder the large scale deployment of DR services. Our DR framework incorporates modern Smart Grid technologies, such as fog-enabled and IoT devices, DERs and RES to, among others, automate asset handling and various time-consuming workflows. To guarantee interoperability, our system employs OpenADR, which standardizes the communication of DR signals among energy stakeholders. Our approach acknowledges the need for decentralization and employs blockchains and smart contracts to deliver a secure, privacy-preserving, tamper-resistant, auditable and reliable DR framework. Blockchains provide the infrastructure to design innovative DR schemes and incentivize active consumer participation as their aforementioned properties promote transparency and trust. In addition, we harness the power of smart contracts which allows us to design and implement fully automated contractual agreements both among involved stakeholders, as well as on a machine-to-machine basis. Smart contracts are digital agents that ""live"" in the blockchain and can encode, execute and enforce arbitrary agreements. To illustrate the potential and effectiveness of our smart contract-based DR framework, we present a case study that describes the exchange of DR signals and the autonomous instantiation of smart contracts among involved participants to mediate and monitor transactions, enforce contractual clauses, regulate energy supply and handle payments/penalties.","","978-1-7281-0653-3","10.1109/EEEIC.2019.8783521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8783521","demand response;fog computing;IoT devices;blockchains;smart contracts;virtual node;end-to-end security","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Smart grids;Stakeholders;Security;Load management;Power system stability","","13","","36","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The FoT paradigm features the incorporation of fog computing power, which empowers not only the IoT applications, but more importantly the scalable and efficient management of the system itself. FoT utilizes a flat-structured virtualization plane and a hierarchical control plane, both of which extend to the network edge and can be reconfigured in real time, to achieve various design goals. In addition to describing the detailed design of the FoT paradigm, we also highlight challenges and opportunities involved in the deployment, management, and operation of such an on-demand IoT platform.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many advantages with broad applications in many areas including environmental monitoring, which makes it a very important part of IIoT. However, energy depletion and hardware malfunctions can lead to node failures in WSNs. The industrial environment can also impact the wireless channel transmission, leading to network reliability problems, even with tightly coupled control and data planes in traditional networks, which obviously also enhances network management cost and complexity. In this paper, we introduce a new software defined network (SDN), and modify this network to propose a framework called the improved software defined wireless sensor network (improved SD-WSN). This proposed framework can address the following issues. 1) For a large scale heterogeneous network, it solves the problem of network management and smooth merging of a WSN into IIoT. 2) The network coverage problem is solved which improves the network reliability. 3) The framework addresses node failure due to various problems, particularly related to energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the reliability of wireless sensor networks, by developing certain schemes to reduce energy consumption and the delay time of network nodes under IIoT conditions. Experiments have shown that the improved approach significantly reduces the energy consumption of nodes and the delay time, thus improving the reliability of WSN.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2017.7510751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232592","","Wireless sensor networks;Software reliability;Switches;Energy consumption;Software","","71","","","","20 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thanks to the flexibility of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the UAV-assisted MEC can serve mobile terminals (MTs) effectively, i.e., the computing server installed on the UAV can flexibly change its location to serve MTs. Moreover, since non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is able to accommodate massive connectivity, the NOMA-based and UAV-assisted MEC can provide flexible computing services for MTs in large-scale access networks (e.g., sensor networks and Internet of Things). However, due to the diversity of the UAV's trajectory and the interference among MTs introduced by NOMA, the performance (e.g., energy consumption and delay) of the NOMA-based and UAV-assisted MEC system is adversely affected. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the largest energy consumption among MTs by jointly optimizing the trajectory, task data and computing resource allocations, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, to minimize the largest energy consumption among MTs with lower complexity, we propose a fixed point service scheme and optimize the location of the fixed point.

Hence, if IoTs would send not only images but also analyzed results to the server, it would reduce server loads; however, the conventional CNN is too large to implement this. We propose a single-filter CNN model that can be implemented even on a small IoT. Our CNN model is of minimal configuration with an input layer, an affine transformation layer, a convolution layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connection layer. We evaluate our proposed CNN model with two experiments. First, we check whether it can learn the eleven basic shapes, i.e., a circle, a triangle, a square, etc. Second, we check whether it can classify the basic shapes against their shape reduction and their noise mixture. Results of the first experiment show that our system can classify all the basic shapes perfectly, results of the second experiment show that accuracy depends on the types of filters for both the scaled-shape classification and the inverse-pixel noise-shape classification.","2325-5994","978-1-5386-5826-0","10.1109/ICAwST.2018.8517219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8517219","Convolutional Neural Network(CNN);Feature Map;IoT;Pooling Layer.","Shape;Convolution;Servers;Training;Art;Image recognition;Sensors","","3","","8","IEEE","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The bridge output is directly sampled by the ADC through fully passive correlated-double-sampling (CDS) approach, which enables a fully dynamic operation. The design is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology. Thanks to the dynamic nature of the CDC, sampling rates from 1 S/s up to 100 kS/s are supported and capacitances from 1.23 to 24.59 pF can be digitized, while the power scales inherently from 0.1 nW to 1 μW. Optionally, the range can be further extended to 100 pF, and oversampling can be used to enhance resolution. This makes the design versatile to efficiently deal with a variety of sensors having different speed and resolution requirements and different capacitance values.

Look, Listen, and Learn (L3), a recently proposed state-of-the-art transfer learning technique, mitigates the first challenge by training self-supervised deep audio embeddings through binary Audio-Visual Correspondence (AVC), and the resulting embeddings can be used to train a variety of downstream audio classification tasks. However, with close to 4.7 million parameters, the multi-layer L3-Net CNN is still prohibitively expensive to be run on small edge devices, such as ""motes"" that use a single microcontroller and limited memory to achieve long-lived self-powered operation. In this paper, we comprehensively explore the feasibility of compressing the L3-Net for mote-scale inference. We use pruning, ablation, and knowledge distillation techniques to show that the originally proposed L3-Net architecture is substantially overparameterized, not only for AVC but for the target task of sound classification as evaluated on two popular downstream datasets. Our findings demonstrate the value of fine-tuning and knowledge distillation in regaining the performance lost through aggressive compression strategies.

However, it also opens the possibility for attackers to eavesdrop the broadcast data or to pretend to be another node or device. These two attacks define the protection goals, namely, confidentiality and authenticity. Traditionally, both are solved by cryptographic approaches exploiting knowledge available in the surrounding infrastructure. The novel communication paradigms for the Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems do not scale with the standard cryptographic approach. Instead it is possible to exploit properties of the underlying physical channel to provide countermeasures against eavesdropping and impersonation attacks. Thereby, the random fading channel induces uncertainty which is detrimental but at the same time also helpful. In this paper, we review and describe a generalized model for physical-layer-based confidential data transmission and wireless authentication. A key role is played by the channel uncertainty and available design dimensions such as time, frequency, and space. We show that wireless authentication and secret-key generation can work in multicarrier and multiple-antenna systems and explain how even outdated channel state information can help to increase the available secure degrees of freedom. This survey focuses on the system design of wireless physical-layer confidentiality and authenticity under channel uncertainty.

However, as any centralized service, this architecture is susceptible to security vulnerabilities, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and port scan attacks. Thus, security methods are necessary to guarantee the normal operation of SDN's central controller. Furthermore, networks are transporting an increasingly amount of information day by day, which could mean data loss in case of long network unavailability. For this reason, security mechanisms must operate online, with fast-responding countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the detected attacks over the SDN. In this paper, we present a fast SDN defense system against DDoS and port scan attacks, which runs directly into the central controller and uses a game theoretical approach for attack mitigation. For the detection, we compare three different approaches, particle swarm optimization, multi-layer perceptron neural network, and discrete wavelet transform. We test our approach over IP flow data generated over Mininet network emulator, along with floodlight controller, and the presented defense system achieved good outcomes for both detection and mitigation processes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878576","CAPES, due to the concession of scholarships; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico(grant numbers:308348/2016-8,304066/2015-0); Federal University of Paraná (UFPR)(grant numbers:Banpesq/2014016797); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514012","DDoS;DWT;MLP;port scan;PSO;SDN","Anomaly detection;Computer crime;IP networks;Discrete wavelet transforms;Internet of Things;Software","","24","","54","OAPA","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the system scale is large with a massive number of tags, deterministic search can be prohibitively expensive, and probabilistic search has been advocated, seeking a balance between reliability and time efficiency. Given a failure probability  $\frac {1}{\mathcal {O}(K)}$ , where  $K$  is the number of tags, state-of-the-art solutions have achieved a time cost of  $\mathcal {O}(K \log K)$  through multi-round hashing and verification. Further improvement, however, faces a critical bottleneck of repetitively verifying each individual target tag in each round. In this paper, we present an efficient tree-based tag search (TTS) that approaches  $\mathcal {O}(K)$  through batched verification. The key novelty of TTS is to smartly hash multiple tags into each internal tree node and adaptively control the node degrees. It conducts bottom–up search to verify tags group by group with the number of groups decreasing rapidly. Furthermore, we design an enhanced tag search scheme, referred to as TTS+, to overcome the negative impact of asymmetric tag set sizes on time efficiency of TTS. TTS+ first rules out partial ineligible tags with a filtering vector and feeds the shrunk tag sets into TTS. We derive the optimal hash code length and node degrees in TTS to accommodate hash collisions and the optimal filtering vector size to minimize the time cost of TTS+. The superiority of TTS and TTS+ over the state-of-the-art solution is demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. Specifically, as reliability demand on scales, the time efficiency of TTS+ reaches nearly 2 times at most that of TTS.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2018.2879979","Beijing Institute of Technology; Canada NSERC Discovery; NSERC E.W.R.

In this paper, we present EMMA, an edge-enabled publish-subscribe middleware that addresses these challenges. EMMA continuously monitors network QoS and orchestrates a network of MQTT protocol brokers. It transparently migrates MQTT clients to brokers in close proximity to optimize QoS.

Such devices often perform critical actuation tasks, as well as collect, store and process sensitive data. Therefore, as confirmed by recent examples (such as the Mirai botnet), they also represent very attractive attack targets. To mitigate attacks, remote attestation (RA) has emerged as a distinct security service that aims at detecting malware presence on an embedded device. Most prior RA schemes focus on attesting a single devices and do not scale. In recent years, schemes for collective (group or swarm) RA have been designed. However, none is applicable to autonomous and dynamic network settings. This paper presents US-AID - the first collective attestation schemes for large autonomous dynamic networks of embedded devices. AID verifies overall network integrity by combining continuous in-network attestation with a key exchange mechanism and Proofs-of-non-Absence. Using device absence detection US-AID defends against physical attacks that require disconnecting attacked devices form the network for a non-negligible time. We demonstrate feasibility of US-AID with proof-of-concept implementation on state-of-the-art security architectures for low-end embedded devices and on an autonomous testbed formed of six drones. We also assess its scalability and practicality via extensive simulations.","2575-8462","978-1-5386-8301-9","10.1109/SRDS.2018.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8613950","Security;Attesation;IoT;Embedded Devices","Heart beat;Protocols;Security;Performance evaluation;Malware;Hardware","","22","","29","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, as a classic application of Internet of Things (IoT), the vehicular network can provide more information services for its human users, which makes the vehicular network more socialized. A new concept is then formed, namely ""Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs)"", which bring both benefits of data sharing and challenges of security. Traditional public key infrastructures (PKI) can guarantee user identity authentication in the network; however, PKI cannot distinguish untrustworthy information from authorized users. For this reason, a trust evaluation mechanism is required to guarantee the trustworthiness of information by distinguishing malicious users from networks. Hence, this paper explores a trust evaluation algorithm for VSNs and proposes a cloud-based VSN architecture to implement the trust algorithm. Experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of trust algorithm in a vehicular network environment through building a three-layer VSN model.

For instance, a port authority deploys smart lighting system, then it implements smart gateways, and in the next stage it decides to combine these two, and a smart container positioning system, into a complete port IoT ecosystem. In the context of interoperability, one of the interesting open issues is: how to manage identities of artifacts and entities that constitute the IoT ecosystem. Identity management seems to be relatively easy in the first case - identifier management can be a part of the IoT deployment. However, as soon as multiple artifacts are to be combined, the problem of identification is no longer easy to solve. This is particularly the case when (i) multiple artifacts originate from different vendors (that use their own identity management approaches), and (ii) when the interoperability solution is based on semantic technologies.

The problem is that end users have a hard time assessing the risks induced by connected devices, and often lack the skills and time to administrate their home network. We answer the above challenge by proposing STewARD, a solution that allows users to easily request from their intelligent home network controller the creation of isolated software-defined network slices, to which they assign a required trust level using very simple risk assessment. We build a global trust assessment framework that computes a trust score for each class of devices, based on reported history stored in a blockchain. Network controllers can then leverage this information to connect to slices only those devices that meet the expected trust levels, and can contribute to the crowd-sourced reporting by monitoring the devices' behaviors compared to an expected baseline.","","978-1-7281-1878-9","10.1109/INFCOMW.2019.8845126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845126","Internet of Things;Blockchain;Distributed Ledger;Access Control;Security;Software-Defined Networking;Risk management;Home networking;Trust","Blockchain;Risk management;Home automation;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Cryptography","","21","","20","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These aspects mandate elasticity in many network functions and especially in routing. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is the state-of-the-art routing protocol for resource-constrained devices in environments with signal issues, but it was not designed to support mobility. However, mobility is fundamental in critical WSNs applications, e.g., it improves sensing coverage and brings back connectivity. In this paper, we propose a centralized routing control approach, which exploits the global view of the network inspired by the Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), in order to provide dynamic end-to-end routing service in heterogeneous environments. We briefly present our novel Cross-Layer Control of Data Flows (CORAL) framework, which-in the context of the current work- has been enhanced with management and control features to provide elasticity in the RPL's functionality. In practice we developed and propose dynamic and individual parameters' configuration and adaptation, live monitoring of performance through visualization and Ansible-based protocol's deployment. Our results show that dynamic RPL configuration, which tackles mobility issues on-the-fly, along with individual configuration which handles them separately, can efficiently tune the protocol's performance trade-offs, e.g., between packet delivery ratio (PDR) and routing overhead, bringing up to 35% improvement in PDR and offloading the control overhead from the mobile nodes.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8647237","","Routing;Topology;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Centralized control;Routing protocols","","10","","26","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We assume that every data record is stored by an independent node, which is a typical setup in networks of mobile devices or Internet of things (IoT) applications. In this model we identify a set of possible distributed differentially private SGD implementations. In these implementations all the sensitive computations are strictly local, and any public information is protected by differentially private mechanisms. This means that personal information can leak only if the corresponding node is directly compromised.

Smart meters/sensor and actuator nodes have been used to transfer information from the water network to data centers for further analysis. Due to the underground position of water assets, many water companies tend to deploy battery driven nodes which last beyond the 10-year mark. This prohibits the use of high-sample rate sensing therefore limiting the knowledge we can obtain from the recorder data. To alleviate this problem, efficient data compression enables high-rate sampling, whilst reducing significantly the required storage and bandwidth resources without sacrificing the meaningful information content. This paper introduces a novel algorithm which combines the accuracy of standard lossless compression with the efficiency of a compressive sensing framework. Our method balances the tradeoffs of each technique and optimally selects the best compression mode by minimizing reconstruction errors, given the sensor node battery state. To evaluate our algorithm, real high-sample rate water pressure data of over 170 days and 25 sensor nodes of our real world large scale testbed was used.

The cost of making systems interoperable is a major limiting factor in the adoption of new technology and the envisioned development of production industry. Therefore, methods and concepts enabling efficient interoperation of heterogeneous systems are investigated to understand how the interoperability problem should be addressed. To support this development, we survey the literature on interoperability to identify automation approaches that address semantic interoperability, in particular in dynamic cyber-physical systems at large scale. We find that different aspects of the interoperability problem are investigated, some based on a conventional bottom-up standardization approach, while others consider a goal-driven computational approach; and that the different directions explored are related to open questions that motivates further research.

A lightweight novelty filter is implemented onboard rural handpumps to identify subsets of data as potential infrastructure failure. The “intelligent” summaries of these data subsets are sent to a cloud-based system, where more advanced machine learning approaches are applied to increase the fidelity of potential failure predictions. The proposed method was tested on three independent data sets and found that the on-pump novelty filter could predict failure with up to 61.6% in situ. Incorporating more advanced machine learning methods on the cloud-based platform increased the classifiers’ positive predictive value by at least an additional 10%–73%.

Atypical example of such altruistic device sharing is “tethering”in cellular networks: an owner who uses a smartphone relays data from/to base stations for others who do not have direct connectivity to cellular networks. However, when people share devices, they would be concerned about costs such as battery or bandwidth. Device owners generally want to reduce their costs when they share their devices with someone who is less socially close to them. This is because it was reported that our altruistic behavior has clear correlation with social closeness; the less close someone is to you, the less altruistic actions you take towards that person. Therefore, we propose a system that uses online social relationships to meet device owners' demand for shared-resource management to enable altruistic device sharing. By acquiring and evaluating online social relationships between a device owner and user, the proposed system automatically determines how much resources the user is allowed to use. In this paper, we implemented a prototype system to measure its authentication overhead. Using this actual overhead measured on the prototype system, we conducted a simulation with a large-scale data set of a real social network to verify that: 1) the proposed system limits the resource usage for guest users who are not as close to the device owners and 2) the overhead of the authentication process in the proposed system does not interfere with the resource sharing with guest users who are close to the device owners.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823300","Research Grant from the KDDI Foundation, Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8332486","Social closeness;device sharing;resource management;sharing economy","Sensors;Cloud computing;Mobile handsets;Cellular networks;Social network services;Resource management;Measurement","","5","","45","OAPA","6 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is an important subclass of web information systems and distributed applications which would benefit from stronger transactional support, as typically found in traditional enterprise systems. In this paper, we propose REST+T (REST with Transactions), a transactional Restful data access protocol and API that extends HTTP to provide multi-item transactional access to data and state information across heterogeneous systems.

This paper presents a new topology-aware workload placement strategy to schedule deep learning jobs on multi-GPU systems. The placement strategy is evaluated with a prototype on a Power8 machine with Tesla P100 cards, showing speedups of up to, ≈ 1.30x compared to state-of-the-art strategies; the proposed algorithm achieves this result by allocating GPUs that satisfy workload requirements while preventing interference.

The proposed approach offers: explicit modeling of performance uncertainties in system internals; a realistic resource consumption model; and a key insight into the superiority of guided processing over duty cycling. Generalization from the cascade structure to the more general graph-based one is also presented.

Although several blockchain-based data management platforms for IIoT have been proposed, sensor data are stored outside of the blockchain, meaning that the data integrity and accessibility are not improved. In this paper, we take a different blockchain-based approach for sensor data management; any important sensor data are stored in the blockchain. For realizing this, a series of sensor data is compressed-then-stored in the blockchain by leveraging a fact that many sensor data often have a certain level of periodicity and stability. We have tested our idea against the real sensor data measured at our model factory, and evaluated several performance metrics such as compression ratio, compression/decompression time, process time required to store and retrieve sensor data from our Proof-of-Concept system with Ethereum and the expected blockchain size. From the results, it can be concluded that the proposed platform is viable for small factory cases but needs more technological advancement is required for large scale cases.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005582","","Cloud computing;Contracts;Manufacturing;Data compression;Bitcoin","","4","","31","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For large-scale VANETs, it is important to design efficient transmission schemes for time critical emergency data. Greedy perimeter stateless routing protocol is a typical geographic-based routing protocol and greedy perimeter coordinator routing protocol is typical for map-based but they do not consider the QoS of the transmission link and hence are not suitable for emergency data transmissions. Some bioinspired protocols and situation-aware protocols are more suitable for emergency situations. However, they have some limitations in terms of the computational complexity and convergence rate which can cause large time delays. In this paper, we propose a novel spider-web-like transmission mechanism for emergency data (TMED) in vehicular ad hoc networks, in which a spider-web-like transmission model combining geographic information system and electronic maps is established. In this mechanism, the request-spiders and confirmed-spiders are sent out to obtain the transmission path from a source vehicle to a destination vehicle to improve the packet delivery ratio and average transmission delay of emergency data. TMED combines a dynamic multipriority message queue management method with a restricted greedy forwarding strategy based on position prediction to significantly reduce the end-to-end delay of packets. We use SUMO and NS2 to simulate TMED in a city scenario and compare its performance with GPSR, GPCR, and ACAR based on the packet delivery ratio, average transmission delay, and routing overhead. The simulation results show that TMED outperforms these previously proposed protocols.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2018.2841348","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672131,61571338,U1709218); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367852","Vehicular ad hoc network;emergency data transmission mechanism;spider web-like model;priority queue;VANET routing","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Delays;Routing;Quality of service;Roads","","93","","37","IEEE","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ultra-low standby MCU with embedded NVM using 90 nm CMOS technology is also reported [2], but its SRAM cache is not sufficient for applying imaging processing which requires large memory capacity with imaging sensors in edge computing. Embedded SRAMs can be achieved fast read/write access within a few nanoseconds, but consume standby leakage power for data retention, being dominant power in the sleep mode. To reduce the standby leakage power of embedded SRAMs, the source bias design technique with power-gating is introduced on a bulk CMOS device [3]. In the resume standby (RS) mode, the VSS source bias control for SRAM array is demonstrated as an effective SRAM leakage power reduction. Besides, once the large SRAM array are into the resume standby mode, it takes long time to wake-up again. It is not applicable for high-speed CPU operation. Then, a fast resume standby mode (FRS) for cache memories is proposed to wake-up as much as fast. In that FRS mode, the power supply for SRAM peripheral is cutoff but SRAM array is keeping with a VDD supply. Each standby mode and its circuit diagram are summarized in Fig. 1. Meanwhile, dopant-less channel fully-depleted (FD) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device is proposed [4]-[6] to improve the performance, power, and area (PPA) of embedded SRAMs. FD-SOI enables to control the back-bias (BB) dynamically under the buried-oxide (BOX) to reduce leakage current and/or to improve performance by applying reverse or forward bias, respectively. Fig. 2 presents the block diagram of BB control scheme for voltage scaling in IoT application with FD-SOI structure [7]-[9]. BBs for NMOS (VBN) and PMOS (VBP) can be applied individually by VBB generator (VBB Gen.) circuit. Four operation modes for smart IoT applications are considered. High-performance, normal, low-power operating modes are introduced, along with the required loads in the system. The sleep mode with SRAM data retention for long-term waiting in the sensor nodes is also proposed. Each supply voltage and BB is also shown in Fig. 2. The comparison of embedded SRAM leakage power is shown in Fig. 3.","2573-7503","978-1-7281-0981-7","10.1109/IMW.2019.8739660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8739660","","Random access memory;Internet of Things;Very large scale integration;CMOS technology;Imaging;Sensors;Performance evaluation","","2","","9","IEEE","21 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The low sensitivity and lack of active demodulator on passive tags present significant challenges to the communication, including a unique phase cancellation problem, which significantly affects the range and robustness of a passive tag-to-tag link. We overcome these challenges using innovative tag architecture and also develop a novel multiphase backscatter modulation technique with a learning mechanism that overcomes the phase cancellation problem. This improves the link performance bringing passive tag-to-tag communication closer to practical use. The additional hardware compared to the conventional radio frequency identification tag architecture includes one more terminating impedance in the modulator. The data rate is reduced due to backscatter at two different phases while the increase in the power consumption is negligible. We develop prototype BTTN tag hardware and firmware and evaluate its performance.

It is known to provide competitive accuracy on sequential prediction tasks with much smaller model size and training time compared to conventional ML, and is well-suited for human-centric IoT. In the post-Moore scaling era, where increasing variability has challenged traditional designers, its novel computing method based on randomness can be leveraged for continued performance. This work develops a complete, programmable architecture for ultra energy-efficient supervised classification using HD computing. Its simple construction follows from basic HD operations and its massively parallel, shallow datapath (<; 10 logic layers) resembles in-memory computing. The architecture also supports scalability: multiple such processors can be connected pralallely to increase effective HD dimension. A broad evaluation is performed by comparing HDC and 3 conventional ML algorithms on conventional architectures such as CPU and eGPU for instruction count, energy cost and memory requirements. Finally, a 2048-dim ASIC design is synthesized in a 28nm HK/MG process and benchmarked on 9 supervised classification tasks with varying complexity (such as language recognition and human face detection). The simulated chip exhibits energy efficiency <; 1.5μJ/pred. for the entire benchmark at about 2.5ns cycle time, with most applications requiring <; 700 nJ/pred. As a first complete design working with high dimensional stochastic signals, the main architectural decisions for similar systems harnessing variability in emerging devices (eg.

In this paper, we analyze outage probability for secrecy rate in MIMO wireless systems in the presence of eavesdroppers and jammers for CPS devices. Our proposed approach takes into account the impact of jammers while finding the best response to minimize the jamming/interfering effect (or to enhance the secrecy rate) and the impact of eavesdropper in secrecy rates of the users. We present formal analysis for secrecy outage probability and interception probability considering Rayleigh fading scenario. The performance is evaluated by using numerical results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.

These capabilities provide us with a unique opportunity to understand and tackle complex problems with new novel approaches based on reasoning about data. However, existing 'Big Data' approaches often turn this opportunity into a threat of citizens' privacy and open participation by surveilling, profiling and discriminating people via closed proprietary data mining services. This paper illustrates how to design and build an open participatory platform for privacy-preserving social mining: the Planetary Nervous System. Building such a complex platform in which data sharing and collection is self-determined by the user and is performed in a decentralized fashion within different ubiquitous environments is a challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a modular and compositional design approach based on a model of virtual sensors. Virtual sensors provide a holistic approach to build the core functionality of the Planetary Nervous System but also social mining applications that extend the core functionality. The holistic modeling approach with virtual sensors has the potential to simplify the engagement of citizens in different innovative crowd-sourcing activities and increase its adoption by building communities.

Such short distance limits the applications of ZigBee such as for the large-scale sparse wireless sensor networks and long-distance low data-rate transmission. In this paper, we propose a simple and robust ZigBee transceiver design that supports the transmission distance of 1.2km and moving speed of 60km/h. Such capacity is achieved by two mechanisms, i.e., using the power amplifier and Low-Noise-Amplifier (LNA) on the transmit and receive path, respectively, and dual directional antennas. Furthermore, an antenna switching MAC protocol is proposed to avoid the deafness problem introduced by using directional antennas. Comprehensive field tests have proven the performance of the designed system.

Recent advances in physical layer have optimized energy consumption of IEEE 802.15.4 Physical layer, but energy efficiency of MAC and network layers is also essential to realise Green wireless networks. Though anycast multi-hop communication is initiated by many recent researchers by obtaining reliability, delay and energy expressions, still there is no model that captures relay nodes state wise behaviour effectively. In this paper a new energy model with 3-dimensional Markov MAC model with generalized any cast routing and state behaviour is proposed and developed for asynchronous wireless ad hoc networks. Proposed state behaviour of node model has consideration of MAC and network parameters like minimum backoff exponent, maximum backoff stages and retries along with network parameters like packet length, wake up rate, Sleep, Idle-Listen, Active-Tx and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) states. Results show that total energy of derived model depends on many network and MAC parameters. Affect of most of the considered parameters are analysed with simulation results.

However, considering a large-scale RFID system, collisions occur when multiple tags transmit signals to RFID reader simultaneously, thereby we observe significant degradation of the efficiency of these applications. Besides, in practice, since tags may move into or out of the transmission range of an RFID reader, three different types of tags coexist: dwelling tags, arriving tags, and leaving tags. In this context, it is necessary to design a novel anti-collision protocol which can distinguish them to achieve efficient tag identification. Nevertheless, we observe that existing protocols fail in fully utilizing the differences of the three types of tags. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel protocol, Durable Tree Slotted ALOHA-based protocol (DTSA), to further improve the efficiency obtained in the literature. In general, DTSA distinguishes the three types of tags based on the obtained information from the last identification process. Moreover, DTSA promptly resolves the collisions for the arriving tags and identifies the dwelling tags one-by-one without any collisions.

Unlike physical signal fusion (that can leverage solid analytic foundations derived from physical properties of fused signals), data reliability assessment from arbitrary online open sources is a harder problem. At least two difficulties arise. First, source reliability is harder to estimate from first principles due to lack of visibility into the sensing and subsequent processing stages for published data. Second, by virtue of being open, some sources can be copied by others, leading to correlated errors at a large scale. This paper presents a recursive truth estimator for online public data streams that addresses the above two problems. We focus on categorical data. Many truth-finding systems were developed to cope with unreliable categorical data. Most of them are designed for batch analysis of bulk datasets. This work extends previous efforts by developing an online recursive estimator. Unlike previous recursive fact-finders, ours is the first that can jointly handle (i) changes in the population of sources over time, (ii) changes in the ground-truth state of the physical phenomenon being observed (that result in the appearance of conflicting claims), and (iii) correlated errors due to potential copying among sources. Results show that our algorithm not only outperforms other recursive fact-finders in the case of changing ground-truth state, but also improves estimation accuracy of static state.","2325-2944","978-1-5386-5470-5","10.1109/DCOSS.2018.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510937","Reliability;Sensors;Observers;Noise Measurement;Computer Science","Reliability;Silicon;Internet of Things;Estimation;Data models;Correlation;Sociology","","1","","27","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a new LPWAN architecture called sensor network over white spaces (SNOW) by exploiting the TV white spaces. The SNOW is the first highly scalable LPWAN over TV white spaces that enable asynchronous, bi-directional, and massively concurrent communication between numerous sensors and a base station. This is achieved through a set of novel techniques. The SNOW has a new OFDM-based physical layer that allows the base station using a single antenna-radio: 1) to send different data to different nodes concurrently and 2) to receive concurrent transmissions made by the sensor nodes asynchronously. It has a lightweight media access control protocol that: 1) efficiently implements per-transmission acknowledgments of the asynchronous transmissions by exploiting the adopted OFDM design and 2) combines CSMA/CA and location-aware spectrum allocation for mitigating hidden terminal effects, thus enhancing the flexibility of the nodes in transmitting asynchronously. We implement the SNOW in GNU radio using universal software radio peripheral devices. Experiments through deployments in three radio environments—a large metropolitan city, a rural area, and an indoor environment—as well as large-scale simulations demonstrated that the SNOW drastically enhances the scalability of a sensor network and outperforms existing techniques in terms of scalability, energy, and latency.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2018.2856197","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CRII-1565751 (NeTS),CNS-1320921 (NeTS),1646579 (CPS)); Fullgraf Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428447","White space;sensor network;LPWAN;OFDM","Snow;White spaces;Wireless sensor networks;OFDM;Scalability;Peer-to-peer computing;TV","","26","","50","IEEE","7 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many IoT devices run with weak or manufacturer-supplied default passwords, which make them highly vulnerable to various forms of credential theft attacks. Furthermore, the hackers may use stolen identities or counterfeit identities of rogue devices to connect to the IoT network.

This contribution aims to provide, through the use of an appropriate mathematical model, a thorough analysis of the problem concerning the penetration depth of a thermomechanical signal in deformable, anisotropic and inhomogeneous thermal conductors. Imagining to refer to a micro/nanoscale framework, it is evident that the classical models theorized to describe the heat transfer are no longer applicable, while the high-order effects linked to the thermal lagging phenomena and closely related to the number of heat carriers involved become increasingly important; moreover it is reasonable to assume, dealing with such scales, that the deformations caused by the temperature variations are small enough to be modeled under the hypotheses typical of the linear thermoelasticity. With these assumptions, and although our results remain valid even for more general shapes, we consider here just for convenience a cylindrical domain filled by a thermoelastic material, and assume that its lower base is subjected to appropriate thermomechanical actions defined externally, investigating through a suitable initial-boundary value problem the spatial behavior of the transient solutions in terms of existence of an influence domain of the assigned data. The analysis is concluded taking into account, by way of example, single-layer graphene and showing some graphic comparisons related to different expansion orders, through which the influence on the signal's depth of the related high-order effects is evident.","","978-1-5386-6405-6","10.1109/EESMS.2018.8405816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405816","","Mathematical model;Heating systems;Thermomechanical processes;Heat transfer;Tensile stress;Transient analysis;Boundary conditions","","1","","13","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, miniaturizing EH devices to supply low power and small form factor IoT devices is still challenging and not always effective. In fact, EH from the miniaturized is more challenging due to strict constraints in terms of size, weight, and cost. Among other technologies, wireless power transmission is growing of popularity due to the fact that it can be controlled and it is less unpredictable than environments sources. This paper presents a review of technologies for wireless power transmission that can supply cm-scale low power IoT devices. Additionally, this paper provides in-field evaluation with mm-scale antennas of radio frequency power transmission using a commercial system: Powercast. Experimental results focus on evaluating the power flowing in the battery, which also includes the conversion losses, for different distances and antennas. Infield evaluation shows that it is possible to achieve mW of usable power to one meter and hundreds of μW at few meters.

State-of-the-art technology suggests building a controlled workspace using large-scale deployment of wireless sensors. To overcome the technological challenges in scalability and heterogeneity for large-scale industrial deployment, group-based industrial wireless sensor networks (GIWSNs) are suggested, in which wireless sensors are divided into multiple groups for multiple monitoring tasks, and each group of sensors is deployed densely within a subarea in a large plant or along a long production/assembly line, while connectivity between groups is required. As wireless sensors are equipped with batteries with limited power, it has been challenging to plan sleep schedules of sensors, which are influenced significantly by deployment of such a large-scale GIWSN. However, most previous works on wireless sensor networks independently investigated deployment and sleep scheduling problems, both of which have been shown to be NP-hard. Therefore, this work jointly considers deployment and sleep scheduling of sensors in a GIWSN along a production line. Via the theory of symmetries, we alleviate the computational concerns from multiple groups to one group and another medium-size group. Then we propose a hybrid harmony search and genetic algorithm, which incorporates deployment and sleep schedules to reduce energy consumption. Simulations verify this joint methodology to effectively achieve energy efficiency.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2016.7588228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7588228","","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Job shop scheduling;Robots;Production facilities;Wireless communication;Green design;Internet of Things;Smart devices","","78","","15","IEEE","14 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

When the system scale is large with a massive number of tags, deterministic search can be prohibitively expensive, and probabilistic search has been advocated, seeking a balance between reliability and time efficiency. Given a failure probability [1/(O(K))], where K is the number of tags, state-of-the-art solutions have achieved a time cost of O(K log K) through multi-round hashing and verification. Further improvement however faces a critical bottleneck of repetitively verifying each individual target tag in each round. In this paper, we present a novel Tree-based Tag Search (TTS) that approaches O (K) through batched verification. TTS smartly hashes multiple tags into each internal tree node and adaptively controls the node degrees. It conducts bottom-up search to verify tags group by group with the number of groups decreasing rapidly. We derive the optimal hash code length and node degrees to accommodate hash collisions, and demonstrate the superiority of TTS through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. In particular, we show that, with increasing reliability demand and system size, TTS achieves an even higher performance gain, making it a highly scalable solution.","","978-1-5386-4128-6","10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485912","","Reliability;Radiofrequency identification;Search problems;Servers;Probabilistic logic;Conferences;RF signals","","14","","28","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving ECG based Active Authentication (PPEA2) scheme that is deployable on power-limited wearable systems (e.g. fitness tracker systems, health monitoring systems for solider in the battlefield, and large-scale health monitoring infrastructure for rapid response systems). The proposed scheme is capable of supporting active authentication of users by utilizing live stream of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to derive unique authentication parameters. In addition to providing active authentication, we incorporated a privacy-preserving feature into the design of our system. The scheme preserves the privacy of the users ECG data features by employing a light-weight secure computation approach based on secure weighted hamming distance computation from oblivious transfer to compute a joint set between two participating entities without revealing the authentication parameters to either of them.

The system is formulated as a dynamic resource allocation (DRA) problem of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) at each decision point with the objective of minimizing the total cost for users. Based on a tree representation of the solution space for the matching pairs, we combine Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and some heuristic rules to find a nearly global-optimal matching order (parking users and resources) within a short time.

However, the diminishing benefits from transistor scaling and conventional optimization techniques necessitates moving beyond common practices. Approximate computing is one such unconventional technique that has shown promise in pushing the boundaries of general-purpose processing. This paper sets out to employ approximation for processors that are commonly used in cyber-physical domains and may become building blocks of Internet of Things. To this end, we propose AxMemo to exploit the computation redundancy that stems from data similarity in the inputs of code blocks. Such input behavior is prevalent in cyber-physical systems as they deal with real-world data that naturally harbors redundancy. Therefore, in contrast to existing memoization techniques that replace costly floating-point arithmetic operations with limited number of inputs, AxMemo focuses on memoizing blocks of code with potentially many inputs. As such, AxMemo aims to replace long sequences of instructions with a few hash and lookup operations. By reducing the number of dynamic instructions, AxMemo alleviates the von Neumann and execution overheads of passing instructions through the processor pipeline altogether. The challenge AxMemo facing is to provide low-cost hashing mechanisms that can generate rather unique signature for each multi-input combination. To address this challenge, we develop a novel use of Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC) to hash the inputs. To increase lookup table hit rate, AxMemo employs a two-level memo-ization lookup, which utilizes small dedicated SRAM and spare storage in the last level cache. These solutions enable AxMemo to efficiently memoize relatively large code regions with variable input sizes and types using the same underlying hardware. Our experiment shows that AxMemo offers 2.64× speedup and 2.58× energy reduction with mere 0.2% of quality loss averaged across ten benchmarks. These benefits come with an area overhead of just 2.1%.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980340","Memoization;Approximate Computing;Hardware-Software Co-Design","","","","","34","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the initial studies in IoT were focused primarily on scaling the existing radio solutions for higher numbers of small-data and low-cost sensors, the current developments aim at supporting wearable augmented/virtual reality platforms, moving industrial robots, driving (semi-)autonomous vehicles, and flying drones, which produce large amounts of data. To satisfy these rapidly growing performance demands, the 5G-grade IoT is envisioned to increasingly employ millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where wider bandwidths promise to enable higher data rates and low-latency communication. While the mainstream trend in mmWave-based IoT is to rely on licensed bands around 28 GHz or leverage unlicensed bands at 60 GHz, in this work we introduce a conceptual vision for the integrated use of these frequencies within a single radio access system named 5G over unlicensed spectrum or 5G-U. We study the performance of 5G-U in supporting stringent IoT use cases, discuss and compare the alternative strategies for spectrum management in 5G-U, and demonstrate that a harmonized utilization of licensed and unlicensed bands provides notable performance improvements in both device-centric and network-centric metrics.

A thing that related to data security is data storage security. One of the data that needs to be secure is the door lock data access. This data must not be vulnerable to counterfeiting and hacking, because a door is directly related to the safety of the homeowner. Door lock access data can be used to find out who and when someone is in or out of the house, hence we can increase the home security if something suspicious happens. However, we must guarantee the integrity of the door lock access data. A method that can be used to ensure data integrity is making a blockchain-based system as data storage because the properties of blockchain are immutable and nonrepudiation. This study uses the Ethereum blockchain platform to store door lock access data and smart contracts to manage the policies. In addition, this study conducts a test to analyze the security level of the proposed system by using an avalanche effect method.

In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based approaches. We analyze the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best tradeoff between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget.

To address the need for self-adaptation in such environments, techniques for detecting environment changes and re-learning behaviours appropriate to those changes have been proposed. However, with the heterogeneity of sensor inputs, the problem of self-adaptation permeates one level deeper; in order for the learnt behaviour to adapt, the underlying environment representation needs to adapt first. The granularity of the RL state space might need to be adapted to learn more efficiently, or to match the new granularity of input data. This paper proposes an implementation of Constructivist RL (Con-RL), enabling RL to learn and continuously adapt its state space representations. We propose a Multi-Layer Growing Neural Gas (ML-GNG) technique, as an extension of the GNG clustering algorithm, to autonomously learn suitable state spaces based on sensor data and learnt actions at runtime. We also create and continuously update a repository of state spaces, selecting the most appropriate one to use at each time step. We evaluate Con-RL in two scenarios: the canonical RL mountain car single-agent scenario, and a large-scale multi-agent car and ride-sharing scenario. We demonstrate its ability to adapt to new sensor inputs, to increase the speed of learning through state space optimization, and to maintain stable long-term performance.","1949-3681","978-1-7281-2731-6","10.1109/SASO.2019.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780532","dynamic adaptation;reinforcement learning","Heuristic algorithms;Switches;Reinforcement learning;Clustering algorithms;Automobiles;Robot sensing systems;Aerospace electronics","","6","","28","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most available wireless standards are power-hungry and, therefore, not suitable for energy scavenging. In this paper, we motivate ultranarrowband as an energy-scavenging-compatible wireless technology for low-throughput wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The ultra-narrowband approach is energy-efficient for two case scenarios. The first one is for WSNs with a large coverage area. The second case scenario is where WSN nodes experience a high level of interference from other co-existing communication systems. Two practical use cases are studied numerically, one for each case scenario. In both cases, on a node level, the link is significantly imbalanced between the transmitting and receiving sections in terms of energy consumption and data rate. However, in case of an interference-rich environment, the radiated power from the WSN base station as well as the WSN nodes is preferred to be as low as possible, thus leading to a more balanced link.","2166-9589","978-1-5386-3531-5","10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292562","Energy scavenging;Internet of Things;ultra low power;ultra narrowband;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Batteries;Base stations;Optimization;Energy harvesting;Power demand","","1","","23","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such BIMs are normally developed during the building design phase and reused continuously during the construction and operation phases of the building life-cycle. In current deployments, however, due to lack of interoperability such information (e.g., walls geometry, materials, and so on) must often be recollected and reinputed by WSN commissioning specialists. Open development and planning tools and methodologies can play a key role in fostering interoperability and convergence of BIM and WSN systems. This paper aims at demonstrating how increased interoperability between WSN development-support tools and BIM systems could provide advantages to developers, integrators, domain specialist, and BIM users.

In this paper we leverage reactive programming and code mobility to support the entire life-cycle of large-scale IoT systems. Our approach is based on existing programming technologies and offers simple and composable abstractions to developers. We implemented our approach in a middleware called Potato and used it to develop and deploy an IoT application on a Raspberry Pi cluster. We found that using Potato reduces much of the accidental complexity associated with developing and deploying IoT systems, resulting in clean and maintainable programs.","2330-2186","978-1-5386-7899-2","10.1109/CloudCom2018.2018.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591014","iot;code mobility;observables;reactive programming","Programming;Thermometers;Smart phones;Runtime;Software;Buildings","","4","","20","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent additions to public clouds to support connected devices and IoT have the potential to similarly disrupt emerging home-grown and/or proprietary approaches. While early public cloud IoT success stories have focused on smaller-scale scenarios such as connected houses, it is unclear to what extent these new public cloud mechanisms and abstractions are suitable and effective for larger-scale and/or scientific scenarios, which often have a different set of constraints or requirements. In this paper, the design and implementation of a representative cloud-based IoT infrastructure in a specific public cloud – AWS – is presented. The system created is for dynamic vehicle traffic control based on vehicle volumes/patterns and public transport punctuality. We find that constructing server-less, stateful, and data driven IoT applications in AWS that can operate in real-time is non-trivial. The primary challenges span application manageability and design, latency performance, asynchronicity, and scalability.","","978-1-4503-4616-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881617","Cloud;AWS;IoT;PaaS;Public transport;Tra c;Traffic Signal Priority;Smart Cities;Connected vehicles;Automatic control;Data collection;Data analysis","","","2","","10","","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the Internet of Thing expands, our dependence on these systems increases. Many of these interconnected systems are and will be low cost bare-metal systems, executing without an operating system. Bare-metal systems rarely employ any security protection mechanisms and their development assumptions (unrestricted access to all memory and instructions), and constraints(runtime, energy, and memory) makes applying protections challenging. To address these challenges we present EPOXY, an LLVM-based embedded compiler. We apply a novel technique, called privilege overlaying, wherein operations requiring privileged execution are identified and only these operations execute in privileged mode. This provides the foundation on which code-integrity, adapted control-flow hijacking defenses, and protections for sensitive IO are applied. We also design fine-grained randomization schemes, that work within the constraints of bare-metal systems to provide further protection against control-flow and data corruption attacks. These defenses prevent code injection attacks and ROP attacks from scaling across large sets of devices. We evaluate the performance of our combined defense mechanisms for a suite of 75 benchmarks and 3 real-world IoT applications. Our results for the application case studies show that EPOXY has, on average, a 1.8% increase in execution time and a 0.5% increase in energy usage.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-5533-3","10.1109/SP.2017.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958583","Embedded Systems;Diversity;Bare-metal;Security;Cyber-Security;Privilege Overlay","Security;Random access memory;Hardware;Memory management;Runtime;Registers;Embedded systems","","62","","60","IEEE","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose novel encoding methods at the information tag and devise the corresponding symbol detection methods at the reader. In particular, Manchester coding and differential Manchester coding are adopted at the information tag, and the corresponding semi-coherent Manchester (SeCoMC) and non-coherent Manchester (NoCoMC) detectors are developed. In addition, analytical bit-error-rate (BER) expressions are characterized for both detectors assuming either complex Gaussian or unknown deterministic ambient signal. Simulation results show that the BER performance of unknown deterministic ambient signal is better, and the SeCoMC detector outperforms the NoCoMC detector.

Meanwhile, being limited by the spare sense nodes, the air quality information is very coarse in resolution, which brings urgent demands for high-resolution air quality data acquisition. In this paper, we refer the real-time and fine-gained air quality data in city-scale by employing the crowdsource automobiles as well as their built-in sensors, which significantly improves the sensing system's feasibility and practicability. The main idea of this paper is motivated by that the air component concentration within a vehicle is very similar to that of its nearby environment when the vehicle's windows are open, given the fact that the air will exchange between the inside and outside of the vehicle though the opening window. Therefore, this paper first develops an intelligent algorithm to detect vehicular air exchange state, then extracts the concentration of pollutant in the condition that the concentration trend is convergent after opening the windows, finally, the sensed convergent value is denoted as the equivalent air quality level of the surrounding environment. Based on our Internet of Things cloud platform, real-time air quality data streams from all over the city are collected and analyzed in our data center, and then a fine-gained city level air quality map can be exhibited elaborately. In order to demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed method, experiments crowdsourcing 500 floating vehicles are conducted in Beijing city for three months to ubiquitously sample the air quality data.

Typical backscatter tags and computational radio frequency (RF) identification systems are unnecessarily limited to modulating data with “ON-OFF” switching front-ends, which leads to extensive spectrum occupancy, due to the rectangular pulses. This paper sets the foundations to overcome these limitations and proposes designs of RF front-ends that are capable of varying the tag reflection coefficient in a continuous way over time. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated to perform pulse shaping on the backscattered signals, which require significantly reduced BW. The principles presented in this paper will enable sophisticated tags to perform complex modulation schemes under BW constraints, while maintaining a very low RF front-end complexity, using a single nonlinear component such as a p-i-n diode or field-effect transistor. Migrating the idea of pulse shaping from complex power-demanding active radios to such minimal RF front-ends will complete backscatter radio as a communication scheme for simple RF tags and sensors in large-scale deployments.

As advanced tools, smart meters can ensure the timely reading of HSPS data, automating metering and producing fine-grained data. However, to ensure the dynamic data management and a better understanding of HSPS operations, it is crucial to analyze and forecast these digital records for decision-making and smart control. Up to now, deep learning algorithms have only been applied sparsely in the field of renewable energy power forecasting. In this paper, we apply an auto-configurable middleware based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for several forecasting time dimensions to choose the significant timescale for learning setting. The results show that our deep-learning model has good performances compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for the whole proposed learning timescale. However, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) seems better than our proposed auto-LSTM algorithm, but it takes much execution time for 15 min and 30 min-ahead forecasting. Thus, the day-ahead forecasting is the most efficient timescale in our case.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622800","Auto-LSTM;Home Solar Power Systems;PV power forecasting;Smart meters","Forecasting;Predictive models;Deep learning;Time series analysis;Smart meters;Data models","","16","","24","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional way to manage WSNs is not suitable for this type of applications, because manually managing and monitoring every single sensor would be too expensive, time consuming and error prone. Moreover, unattended sensors may suffer of several issues that progressively make their measures unreliable and consequently useless. For this reason, several automatically techniques have been studied and implemented for the detection and correction of measurements from sensors which are affected by errors caused by aging and/or drift. These methods are grouped under the name of self-calibration techniques.

These data can be used to monitor, detect and anticipate different kinds of infrastructure vulnerabilities and anomalies, as well as to implement more personalized services that could improve citizens' life. In this new context, full of opportunities, it is difficult to foresee and develop, in advance, the set of applications and services that can be potentially useful for administrators and citizens to solve the manifold compelling needs a city may have to face. Novel ICT paradigms and technologies can help designing agile, general-purpose smart city platforms aimed at supporting the collection and treatment of large-scale, multi-source (streams of) data and the development of novel applications that could fulfill diverse functional requirements under strict non-functional constraints. This paper presents the reference architecture, a prototype implementation and a city-scale case-study evaluation of PROMENADE, a platform that exploits IoT/Fog/Cloud paradigms, microservices and DevOps infrastructures to guarantee continuous development of robust and reliable applications for real-time monitoring and analysis of traffic data generated by IoT devices in large smart cities.

But, the single point of management in physically centralized SDN architectures is a potential point of failure and a bottleneck that compromises network reliability and performance. Such centralized designs may also face scalability challenges especially in networks with a large number of hosts (e.g. IoT-like networks). To avoid such concerns, SDN control architectures are usually designed as physically distributed systems. This raises practical challenges about the best approach to decentralizing the control plane while maintaining the logically centralized network view. In particular, determining the number of controllers and locating them in the network is a hard task that should be addressed appropriately. This paper proposes two novel strategies that cover different aspects of the controller placement problem with respect to performance and reliability criteria. These strategies use two types of heuristics that are compared and assessed on large-scale topologies to provide operators with guidelines on how to find their optimal controller placement that meets their specific needs.","2165-963X","978-3-901882-98-2","10.23919/CNSM.2017.8255989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255989","","Measurement;Reliability;Control systems;Topology;Optimization;Network topology;Clustering algorithms","","18","","9","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We can witness the expansion of the IoT architecture where smart devices can interact with each other and they can operate as intelligent agents to control our environment. Usually, these devices have a local knowledge base providing information for the concrete actions. In order to implement a higher level of intelligence, the devices should interact with humans in a more general environment. The main representation form of common sense knowledge in intelligent applications is ontology. Consequently, a widescope and detailed knowledge base that can cover general requirements should be stored in a general ontology server. This means that ontology databases should be able to manage huge amount of data in an efficient way. Although the concept of computerized ontology management is almost 10 years old (Gruber introduced this term in 2009), currently we have experiences only with smaller and separate ontologies. We can expect though that the future development trends in IoT will require the implementation of new kinds of large scale ontology servers, too. This paper presents first the main requirements on a general ontology server focusing on the demands in an IoT architecture. The main goal of the paper is then to compare the efficiency of three implementation alternatives: native RDF triplet storage, relational database storage and graph database storage.","","978-1-5386-4762-2","10.1109/CarpathianCC.2018.8399655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399655","ontology;IoT;ontology server;IoT ontology;semantic database","Ontologies;Servers;Databases;OWL;Resource description framework;Semantics;Computer architecture","","1","","34","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VSF creates virtual sensors (VSs) at the sink to exploit the temporal and spatial correlations amongst sensed data. Using an adaptive model at every sensing iteration, the VSs can predict multiple consecutive sensed data for all the nodes with the help of sensed data from a few active nodes. We show that even when the sensed data represent different physical parameters (e.g., temperature and humidity), our proposed technique still works making it independent of physical parameter sensed. Applying our technique can substantially reduce data communication among the nodes leading to reduced energy consumption per node yet maintaining high accuracy of the sensed data. In particular, using VSF on the temperature data from IntelLab and GreenOrb data set, we have reduced the total data traffic within the network up to 98% and 79%, respectively. Corresponding average root mean squared error of the predicted data per node is as low as 0.36 °C and 0.71 °C, respectively.

Such an understanding is important to help us anticipate future trends in the organization of large-scale distributed networked deployments. Such deployments are expected to arise in support of a wide variety of applications, including vehicular networks and the Internet of Things. Two new biologically-inspired spectrum access strategies are presented here, and compared with a random access baseline strategy. The proposed strategies embody a range of plausible assumptions concerning the sensing capabilities and social characteristics of individual secondary users. Considering these strategies as the basis of a game against the field, we use replicator dynamics within an evolutionary game-theoretic analysis to derive insights into the physical conditions necessary for each of the strategies to be evolutionarily stable. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the physical channel conditions almost always uniquely determine which one of the three (pure) strategies is selected, and that no mixed strategy ever survives. We show that social tendencies naturally become advantageous for secondary users as they find themselves situated in network environments with heterogeneous channel resources. Hardware test-bed experiments confirm the validity of the analytic conclusions. Taken together, these results predict the emergence of social behavior in the spectrum access etiquette of secondary users as cognitive radio technology continues to advance and improve. The experimental results show an increase in the throughput of up to 90%, when strategy evolution is continuously operational, compared with any static strategy.

Previous efforts to limit such consumption have included demand response and smart residential environments. However, recent research has shown that such approaches can actually increase the overall energy consumption due to the numerous complex human psychological processes that take place when interacting with electrical appliances. In this paper we propose a social-behavioral aware framework for energy management in smart residential environments. We envision a smart home where appliances are interconnected using the paradigm of the Internet of Things and where users have a maximum energy budget, for example to reduce their energy bills. Using an experimental and interdisciplinary approach, we define social behavioral models to understand how users perceive different appliances, and how the use of some appliances are contingent on the use of others. We make use of large scale online surveys involving 1500 users to gather data and quantify such models. Based on these models we define a social behavioral aware user utility that is adopted as the objective function of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. The problem looks for a set of appliances that maximizes the user utility while ensuring that the energy budget constraint is met. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and provide a heuristic method to efficiently find a solution. Results on synthetic and real data show that our approach outperforms previously proposed solutions that do not consider the social-behavioral implications, and it requires few iterations to converge towards a final solution.","2325-2944","978-1-5386-5470-5","10.1109/DCOSS.2018.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510978","Smart Homes, Energy Consumption, Social-Behavioral aware Optimization","Home appliances;Psychology;Energy consumption;Optimization;Smart homes;Monitoring;Generators","","6","","43","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Embedded devices are profoundly different than traditional personal computers. In fact, while personal computers run predominantly on x86-flavored architectures, embedded systems rely on a variety of different architectures. In turn, this aspect causes a large number of these systems to run some variants of the Linux operating system, pushing malicious actors to give birth to ""Linux malware."" To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive study attempting to characterize, analyze, and understand Linux malware. The majority of resources on the topic are available as sparse reports often published as blog posts, while the few systematic studies focused on the analysis of specific families of malware (e.g., the Mirai botnet) mainly by looking at their network-level behavior, thus leaving the main challenges of analyzing Linux malware unaddressed.

The footprint of these networks is huge as well as their computational and communication needs. In order to ease the pressure on resources, research indicates that in many cases a low precision representation (1-2 bit per parameter) of weights and other parameters can achieve similar accuracy while requiring less resources. Using quantized values enables the use of FPGAs to run NNs, since FPGAs are well fitted to these primitives; e.g., FPGAs provide efficient support for bitwise operations and can work with arbitrary-precision representation of numbers. This paper presents a new streaming architecture for running QNNs on FPGAs. The proposed architecture scales out better than alternatives, allowing us to take advantage of systems with multiple FPGAs. We also included support for skip connections, that are used in state-of-the art NNs, and shown that our architecture allows to add those connections almost for free. All this allowed us to implement an 18-layer ResNet for 224×224 images classification, achieving 57.5% top-1 accuracy. In addition, we implemented a full-sized quantized AlexNet. In contrast to previous works, we use 2-bit activations instead of 1-bit ones, which improves AlexNet's top-1 accuracy from 41.8% to 51.03% for the ImageNet classification. Both AlexNet and ResNet can handle 1000-class real-time classification on an FPGA. Our implementation of ResNet-18 consumes 5× less power and is 4× slower for ImageNet, when compared to the same NN on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Smaller NNs, that fit a single FPGA, are running faster then on GPUs on small (32×32) inputs, while consuming up to 20× less energy and power.","","978-1-5386-5555-9","10.1109/IPDPSW.2018.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425399","hardware arhitecture for DNN","Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Artificial neural networks;Kernel;High level languages;Computational modeling;Optimization","","16","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This concept delves into the way a massive volume of data is acquired, processed, analyzed to extract insight from available data. In particular, big data analytics alludes to applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques, data mining techniques, time-series forecasting methods. Decision-makers in power systems have been long plagued by incapability and weakness of classical methods in dealing with large-scale real practical cases due to the existence of thousands or millions of variables, being time-consuming, the requirement of a high computation burden, divergence of results, unjustifiable errors, and poor accuracy of the model. Big data analytics is an ongoing topic, which pinpoints how to extract insights from these large data sets. The extant article has enumerated the applications of big data analytics in future power systems through several layers from grid-scale to local-scale. Big data analytics has many applications in the areas of smart grid implementation, electricity markets, execution of collaborative operation schemes, enhancement of microgrid operation autonomy, management of electric vehicle operations in smart grids, active distribution network control, district hub system management, multi-agent energy systems, electricity theft detection, stability and security assessment by PMUs, and better exploitation of renewable energy sources. The employment of big data analytics entails some prerequisites, such as the proliferation of IoT-enabled devices, easily-accessible cloud space, blockchain, etc. This paper has comprehensively conducted an extensive review of the applications of big data analytics along with the prevailing challenges and solutions.","","978-1-7281-6189-1","10.1109/IPAPS49326.2019.9069391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069391","Big data analytics;Machine learning and data mining;Future power systems;Artificial intelligence;Clustering and classification;Smart grids","Big Data;Machine learning;Data mining;Power system stability;Smart grids;Machine learning algorithms","","21","","28","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of systems have been proposed to effectively detect varieties of attacks in WSNs. However, most previous surveys on WSN attacks focus on detection methods for only one or two types of attacks and lack detailed performance analysis. Additionally, the literature lacks comprehensive studies on security-related data (in short security data) collection in WSNs. In this paper, we first provide an overview of WSNs and classify the attacks in WSNs based on protocol stack layers.

Although there are a number of low-cost turbidity sensors exploited within domestic `white-goods', such as dishwashers, the lack of sensitivity, and power-usage of these devices make them unsuitable for fresh-water quality monitoring purposes. The recent introduction of wireless protocols and hardware, associated with the `Internet-of-Things' concept for machine-to-machine autonomous sensing and control, has enabled the large-scale networked intelligent water turbidity monitoring system that implements relatively low-cost sensors to be developed. The proposed sensor uses both transmitted light and orthogonal (90 degrees) scattered light detection principles, and is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in cost compared to the existing commercial turbidity sensors. With an 850-nm infrared LED, and dual orthogonal photodetectors, the proposed design is capable of measuring turbidity within the range of 0-1000 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) with improved accuracy and robustness as compared with the existing low cost turbidity sensors. The combination of orthogonal and transmitted light detection unit provides both 0-200 NTU high resolution and accuracy sensing and 0-1000 NTU lower resolution and accuracy sensing capability.

In this paper, we investigate the outage probability and symbol-error rate for both HD and full-duplex (FD) transmission schemes in multihop networks subject to interference from randomly distributed third-party devices. We model the locations of the interfering devices as a Poisson point process. We derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability and approximations for the symbol-error rate for HD and FD transmissions employing BPSK and QPSK. The symbol-error rate results are obtained by using a Markov chain model for the multihop decode-and-forward links. This model accurately accounts for the nonlinear dynamical nature of the network, whereby erroneous symbol decoding can be “corrected” by a second erroneous decoding operation later in the network. We verify the analytical results through simulations and show the HD and FD schemes can be utilized to reduce the error-rate and outage probability of the system according to different residual self-interference levels and interferer densities. The results provide clear guidelines for implementing HD and FD in multihop networks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2885756","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/R006377/1 (“M3NETs”),EP/N002350/1 (“Spatially Embedded Networks”)); Royal Society(grant numbers:IF160001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567943","Full-duplex (FD);multihop networks;performance analysis;stochastic geometry","Relays;Interference;Probability;Spread spectrum communication;Power system reliability;Internet of Things;Binary phase shift keying","","24","","29","CCBY","7 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing approaches to cross-technology coexistence incur additional transmission delay and signal processing overhead, which are unaffordable by extremely weak wireless devices such as embedded sensors and computational RFIDs. These schemes hence fail when being applied to emerging application scenarios, such as smart cities and connected healthcare where weak devices play important roles. In this paper, we design and implement EmBee, a new wireless PHY technique that enables cross-technology coexistence at zero cost or performance loss to these extremely weak wireless devices. The basic idea of EmBee is to exploit the diversity of different wireless technologies' spectrum utilization, so as to adaptively reserve occupied spectrum from the strong devices for weak wireless devices' concurrent data transmissions. We have implemented EmBee over custom wireless hardware and evaluated EmBee under different wireless scenarios. Experiment results show that EmBee can effectively support ZigBee transmissions over a fully occupied WiFi channel without causing any extra delay, while only resulting in 10% WiFi throughput loss.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737379","Wireless networks;cross-technology coexistence;spectrum reservation","Zigbee;Wireless communication;Wireless fidelity;Wireless sensor networks;Delays;Bandwidth;OFDM","","18","","28","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering dynamic spectrum access and the limited spectrum resources in cognitive radio sensor networks, sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing based on the modulated wideband converter is introduced. Since the transmission signals are usually modulated by different carrier frequencies, the interested spectrum can be modeled as the multiband signal. Modulated wideband converter (MWC) is an attractive alternative among several sub-Nyquist sampling systems because it has been implemented in practice and the frequency support reconstruction algorithm is the most important part in MWC. However, most existing reconstruction methods require the sparse information, which is difficult to acquire in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a blind multiband signal reconstruction method, referred to as the statistics multiple measurement vectors (MMV) iterative algorithm to bypasses the above problem. By exploiting the jointly sparse property of MMV model, the supports can be obtained by statistical analysis for the reconstruction results. Simulation results show that, without the sparse prior, the statistics MMV iterative algorithm can accurately determine the support of the multiband signal in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio by using various numbers of sampling channels.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859229","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671183,61771163,91438205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8419231","Cognitive radio sensor networks;blind multiband signal reconstruction;sub-Nyquist sampling;multiple measurement vectors;modulated wideband converter","Sensors;Wideband;Signal reconstruction;Wireless sensor networks;Frequency modulation;Reconstruction algorithms;Iterative methods","","13","","39","OAPA","25 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a SVM-based compound-word recognition method in information security. The method is based on the outputs of the existing word segmentation system. It constructs adjacent atom-word digraph according to the statistical co-occurrence features and lexical rules. Next, it produces compound-word candidate set through deep traverse the digraph by the longest match principle. It further filters the candidate set by using a SVM classifier with the help of domain contrast corpus and computer dictionary. We use this method to identify new compound-words from 2200 vulnerability description texts. It achieves a precision of 82.25% and recall of 77.44%.

But this is a double-edged sword, since connectivity also implies (1) to open the door to more attack possibilities, and (2) the targeted system, once breached, can be the support for attacks at a larger scale, possibly involving many connected systems. Our observation is that such devices lack proper hardware and software security protections. Bootloader and Firmware Update (BFU) mechanisms are critical components in the software stack of IoT devices. BFUs are a target of choice since they use the highest privileges and are executed before the system's security policy is set up. An attacker able to compromise the BFU can gain full control over the target system. Moreover, the update mechanism often supported by the BFU is essential to ensure devices can be upgraded and maintained for a long time. If not properly secured, the BFU allows an attacker to gain control over a system throughout its whole lifetime, including future upgrades. In this paper, we provide an overview of the threats targeting BFUs, and existing protections. We cover the hardware and software attacks that are known to the scientific literature. Also, we argue that vulnerabilities to physical attacks, in particular to fault injection attacks, are mostly left un-attended.","","978-1-7281-1031-8","10.1109/NEWCAS44328.2019.8961216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8961216","","","","4","","39","IEEE","20 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A particular season is targeted to survey the pest condition and growth in crop-fields and how the atmospheric conditions are readily involved in this case. If any abrupt changes in the atmosphere have influenced the pest nature, then it has to be studied and tracked properly to form a research database that can be used for precautionary measures in the next season. The sensor network is formed with the atmospheric parameters and interfaced with Raspberry Pi3 which acts as gateway here to store all the data in the cloud. The data can be accessed by any computer or mobile devices from the cloud. By that method, pest identification is easier by accessing this low cost and energy efficient system which is beneficial in a large scale for the agricultural scientists, pest technicians and also farmers if they are trained about the usage and benefits of the system.","","978-1-5386-1442-6","10.1109/I-SMAC.2018.8653695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653695","Atmospheric Parameters;Embedded Technology;Pest Growth;Optimization;Raspberry pi;Gateway;Cloud","Agriculture;Cloud computing;Production;Logic gates;Diseases;Image processing;Servers","","1","","10","IEEE","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many Wi-Fi network systems commonly employee machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Such IDS usually adopt supervised methods that heavily depend on observations of human experts for feature extraction, feature selection, and labeling processes of training data for classification. In this study, using the recently collected Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) which contains real traces of different network attacks types, we propose an unsupervised approach with automatic feature extraction and selection process to replace human intervention and manual labeling process for analyzing a large scale high dimensional data to improve the prediction accuracy of classification to detect 3 most common network attack types - Injection, Flooding, and Impersonate attacks in an IDS with a large scale of high dimensional data.

The exposure of vulnerabilities existing in some specific versions of the core components may cause severe security incidents such as the Heartbleed event in 2014 and the Sambacry event in 2016. Extracting the version information from various firmware binaries is significant for evaluating the influence of such incidents and providing emergency response services. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no scalable and efficient extraction methods for binary version information in IoT firmwares. The commonly used method for traditional softwares requires the running up of the firmwares and interaction such as '-version' to obtain the version information. This method is not applicable for IoT devices, as they are built from various platforms which makes it impossible to simulate all of the interested firmwares at large scale. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate a scalable and efficient binary version extraction framework (termed as PANDORA) for IoT firmwares, which does not rely on the real runtime environment. The main idea of our methodology is to leverage version strings in binaries to get version information. We design a string recover engine (SRE) to recover the missing pieces of those incomplete version strings. We test PANDORA in a dataset containing 2683 IoT binary files.

Conventional Deep Packet Inspection systems that rely on inspection of open fields in TLS and DNS packets, and the trend of encrypting the open fields makes machine learning based systems the only viable option for future networks. Moreover, computational complexity of models becomes crucial for large-scale operations. In this work, we investigated whether simple models, such as Logistic Regression, SVM with linear kernel, and a Decision Tree, have suitable for real-world deployments performance of multiclass classification of IoT traces, given thoughtful features engineering. We introduced a new flow feature of categorical type that describes a set of TCP-flag fields within a flow. In addition, removal of correlated features and feature space transformation via PCA method showed their usefulness in terms of prediction complexity reduction. In order to account for online classification mode, we limited the maximal number of packets within a flow to 10. Moreover, to estimate the upper-bound performance with given features, we compared the simple algorithms with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and a feed-forward neural network. We performed 4-fold cross-validation of models by metrics Accuracy and F1-measure. The test results demonstrated that the introduced feature increases F1-measure for logistic regression from 99.1% in the base case to 99.6%, thus closely approaching more computationally expensive models.

To approach these requirements, the System in Package (SiP) can be a combination of one or more chips plus optionally passive components by using Surface Mount Technology (SMT) and 3D structure of double side into a single package to offer a small form factor, high performance and systemization implemented. The high speed SMT process accomplishes the high-density with more than 50 discrete passive as well as active components and heterogeneous integration on package level approach. The development of double side technology offers the advantage of package size shrinkage by the same integrating discrete passive and active components layout. In this paper, the innovative packaging solutions of 3D double side SiP including the platform for both strip form of substrate base and wafer form of Fan-Out Redistribution Layer (RDL) base will be well introduced. Fan-Out RDL is an extension approach of Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP), this technology is different from conventional wire bond or flip chip packages because the redistribution dielectrics and fine-line plated conductors are used for interconnection to replace the packaging substrates. As a case study, the calculation of 3D SiP package size can be shrunk around 50% area and the total package thickness can achieve around 15% z-height reduction with thin form coreless substrate and Fan-Out RDL technology utilization. The characterization analysis will apply simulation methodology for electrical comparison on DC resistance and parasitic inductance, thermal comparison on Theta JA (°C/W) and warpage comparison on the package structure of 3D double side SiP. Also, the typical reliability testing (Temperature Cycle Test, High Temperature Storage Life Test, Unbiased High Accelerated Stress Test) are built to verify 3D double side SiP structure for future IoT/Wearable and 5G devices application.

RNNs exploit long-term temporal relationships in data by applying repeated, learned transformations. Unlike fully-connected (FC) layers with single vector matrix operations, RNN layers consist of hundreds of such operations chained over time. This poses challenges unique to RNNs that are not found in convolutional neural networks(CNNs) or FC models, namely large dynamic activation. In this paper we present MASR, a principled and modular architecture that accelerates bidirectional RNNs for on-chip ASR. MASR is designed to exploit sparsity in both dynamic activations and static weights. The architecture is enhanced by a series of dynamic activation optimizations that enable compact storage, ensure no energy is wasted computing null operations, and maintain high MAC utilization for highly parallel accelerator designs. In comparison to current state-of-the-art sparse neural network accelerators (e.g., EIE), MASR provides 2×area 3×energy, and 1.6×performance benefits. The modular nature of MASR enables designs that efficiently scale from resource-constrained low-power IoT applications to large-scale, highly parallel datacenter deployments.","2641-7936","978-1-7281-3613-4","10.1109/PACT.2019.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891617","Recurrent neural networks;Accelerator;deep neural network;automatic speech recognition;sparsity","Encoding;Hardware;Recurrent neural networks;Load management;Computer architecture;Hidden Markov models;Acceleration","","29","","67","IEEE","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Singh is just one of millions of Indians who've seen their lives improve in fundamental ways since the government started a biometric identification system called Aadhaar in 2010. The early success - and tremendous scale - of India's efforts are especially important to note at a time when digital financial services are increasingly seen as a key driver in the fight to alleviate poverty, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal No. 1 (SDG 1). Globally, 1 in 9 people go hungry every day, according to the World Food Program. That's nearly 800 million people. And yet, some 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted every year. To combat this problem - and to make progress on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal No. 2 “Zero Hunger” - information and communication technologies (ICTs) are now increasingly being deployed to better connect the hungry to excess food at a scale and speed never before possible. The five-day old baby weighs just 1.5 kilograms - too small to breathe on her own.

But the increasing economy has claimed another unaware victim - the industry scrap. There is a huge problem of disposal, segregation and recycling of industry scrap. This is an alarming situation for industries to make a proper management of these wastes before they become dangerous to health and environment. The waste management includes proper segregation, reuse and disposal to keep public lives safe and to build a sustainable environment. Reuse of useful scrap like metal, plastics etc. needs to be properly segregated before going for processing. Most of the times the segregation is done manually for small scale industries but it is time consuming and less efficient. As a solution for this, a paradigm is developed to automatically segregate metal and plastic from the industry scrap. The system uses IR sensors for level detection and Inductive and capacitive sensors for metal and nonmetal detection. The whole system is controlled through PLC with the voice command given to Google Assistance to start and stop the system. HMI displays the working status of the devices and IOT is used to determine and display the status of metal and plastic bin.","","978-1-7281-4042-1","10.1109/ICCUBEA47591.2019.9128464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128464","Industry Scrap;Segregation;IR Sensors;Inductive and Capacitive Sensors;PLC;HMI;IOT","","","1","","6","IEEE","30 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The asymptotic behavior of throughput for MU-MIMO BC (Multi User MIMO Broadcast) system with simple algorithm is studied. It is shown that the upper bound on sum capacity remains unchanged as that of DPC (Dirty Paper Coding). The simple algorithm takes NI largest power users, reducing the search subset for scheduling from Nu to NI , while achieving the same upper bound. This is an important result in the large number of users regime (or devices for IoT scenario) where users try to get the scared communication resource.

In IoT networks, edge devices are characterized by tight resource constraints and often dynamic nature of data sources, where existing approaches for deploying Deep/Convolutional Neural Networks (DNNs/CNNs) can only meet IoT constraints when severely reducing accuracy or using a static distribution that cannot adapt to dynamic IoT environments. In this paper, we propose DeepThings, a framework for adaptively distributed execution of CNN-based inference applications on tightly resource-constrained IoT edge clusters. DeepThings employs a scalable Fused Tile Partitioning (FTP) of convolutional layers to minimize memory footprint while exposing parallelism. It further realizes a distributed work stealing approach to enable dynamic workload distribution and balancing at inference runtime. Finally, we employ a novel work scheduling process to improve data reuse and reduce overall execution latency. Results show that our proposed FTP method can reduce memory footprint by more than 68% without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, compared to existing work sharing methods, our distributed work stealing and work scheduling improve throughput by  $1.7\times -2.2\times$  with multiple dynamic data sources. When combined, DeepThings provides scalable CNN inference speedups of  $1.7\times$ – $3.5\times$  on 2–6 edge devices with less than 23 MB memory each.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2018.2858384","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1421642); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493499","Deep learning;distributed inference;edge computing;Internet of Things","Task analysis;Runtime;Logic gates;Distributed databases;Dynamic scheduling;Parallel processing;Neural networks;Embedded systems;Deep learning;Edge computing;Internet of Things","","267","","24","IEEE","16 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pub/sub protocols, however, were not designed for this particular scenario and have decoupling properties that make some common task in IoT settings more challenging to achieve. It is, for instance, not straightforward to discover potential publishers of sensor data or to give guarantees that all, a certain number or at least one subscriber of a certain set of possible subscribers will received a message. Because they are missing in the standard, different approaches and implementations tackling those challenges will lead to incompatibilities between users of different systems. In this work, we therefore give an overview of the challenges with discovery and guaranteed delivery to a certain number of subscribers over pub/sub networks in IoT settings and present different possible solutions.

However, this is nearly impossible in a large-scale pig farm owing to the shortage of farm workers. Therefore, we propose an automatic monitoring method in this study to solve the management problem of a large-scale pig farm. Particularly, we aim to detect undergrown pigs in group-housed pig rooms by using deep-learning-based computer vision techniques. Because the typical deep learning techniques require a large computational overhead (i.e., Mask-R-CNN), fast and accurate detection of undergrown pigs on an IoT-based embedded device is very challenging. We first obtain the video monitoring data of group-housed pigs by using a top-view camera that is installed in the pig room, and then detect each moving pig by combining image processing and deep learning techniques. Gaussian Mixture Model is used to detect moving frames and moving objects. In embedded device implementations, by applying deep learning (i.e., TinyYOLO3) to a few frames only with a large number of pixel changes, embedded GPUs can be used efficiently, satisfying the real-time requirement. As a subsequent step, we check the acceptable conditions of the posture and separability from each video frame of the continuous video stream. Finally, to compute the relative size of each pig quickly and accurately, we develop image processing steps to complement the result of deep learning with minimum computational overhead. Furthermore, by pipelining the CPU and GPU steps of a continuous video stream, we can hide the additional image processing time. Based on the experimental results obtained from an embedded device, we confirm that the proposed method can automatically detect undergrown pigs in real-time, by working as an early warning system without any human inspection or measurement of actual weight by a farm worker.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955761","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2018R1D1A1A09081924,2019R1H1A1080140,NRF-2017R1A6A1A03015496); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911419","Smart farm;pig monitoring;computer vision;image processing;deep learning","Image processing;Deep learning;Monitoring;Two dimensional displays;Computer vision;Streaming media;Weight measurement","","18","","39","CCBY","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These applications can first benefit market staff by automating routine tasks or opening possibilities for additional profits. Not only that: for everyday customers, these applications provide more reliable services by eliminating many man-made errors and offer additional services that can be enabled by newly gained connectivities. In this work, we introduce application requirements and technical challenges for such smart market applications and pilot deployment experiences in an urban large-scale market. Our pilot deployment experiences of wireless systems in markets provide quantified knowledge on the impact of various in-market activities on the wireless link performance and led us to design MarketNet, a wireless networking architecture suitable for IoTbased smart market systems.

To this end, data generated by monitoring IoT devices are collected, elaborated and sent to controllers and actuators. The routing of data from IoT sensors to actuators is an integral part of any large-scale industrial network for maintaining critical delay requirements. Centralised schemes are typically used, whereby data are transferred to a central network controller, from where they are accessed by any other node requiring them. This may result in significant overheads and suboptimal resource consumption. In this paper, we propose a distributed, cooperative Data Management Layer (DML), whereby nodes cooperate to store data within the network. The DML is decoupled yet interacts with the underlying Network Plane. Specifically, given a set of data, the sets of nodes generating and requesting them, and a maximum access delay that requesting nodes can tolerate, the DML efficiently identifies a limited set of proxies in the network where data are stored. Given the mentioned constraints, we investigate the (computationally difficult) problem of finding which network nodes to select as proxies and we propose a simple method to address it. We demonstrate that the proposed method (i) guarantees that access delay stays below the given threshold, and (ii) significantly outperforms centralised and even distributed approaches, both in terms of access latency and in terms of maximum latency guarantees.","","978-1-5386-3839-2","10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115846","Industry 4.0;Data Management;Internet of Things","Distributed databases;Actuators;Routing;Sensors;Delays;Routing protocols;Process control","","11","","25","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, we design an algorithm to solve the problem of data redundant for IoT devices. The algorithm iteratively separates a data region into smaller regions. In each round, it chooses a region with highest variability, and separates it into smaller regions. Finally, each region has different sizes and uses its average value to represent itself.

However, this increasing abundance of data requires supercomputers faster and more powerful than were ever built without the need to build a nuclear plant next to each one! Single flux quantum (SFQ) technology has the potential to meet those booming demands for lower power consumption and higher operation speeds in the electronics industry and future exascale supercomputing systems. Nevertheless, the promised benefits of three orders of magnitude lower power at an order of magnitude higher performance have yet to be attained. In particular, variability and scalability have been long-term obstacles for the technology to advance, compete, and replace the well-founded Silicon CMOS. Notwithstanding that SFQ fabrication has quite improved over the past two decades, its level of variability has to be taken into design consideration. Moreover, the absence of an established tools flow hinders the scalability and the automatibility, which are among the trumps of CMOS technology in digital VLSI. Specifically, as a consequence, ultra-high-speed clocking of large-scale SFQ circuits in the presence of large levels of variability represents a tough obstacle for the technology to advance. In this paper, we propose an innovative self-adaptive clocking technique, which is designed to be resilient in such uncertain environments. Whereas the traditional balanced tree zero-skew clocking is not reliable for large-scale SFQ designs, our proposed hierarchical chains of homogeneous clover-leaves clocking inherits its robustness from spatially correlated cell delays and from the timing robustness of the SFQ traditional counter-flow clocking. Our simulations on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits show that our robust clocking costs can be on average within 34% as fast as ideal zero-skew jitter-free clock trees with an average area overhead of 58%. Moreover, lower area overhead is also possible at the cost of performance, demonstrating the possible trade-off between performance and area. We assert that these overheads are acceptable given the benefits of more reliable functionality, as quantified by yield, as well as improved scalability. In particular, previous efforts reported that a similar, but more limited, clocking structure leads to up to 93% higher yield than zero-skew clock trees.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2018.2856836","Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity; Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8412105","Asynchronous;clock distribution networks (CDNs);RSFQ;single flux quantum (SFQ);timing","Clocks;Logic gates;Integrated circuit modeling;Robustness;Scalability;Delays","","13","","58","IEEE","17 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents an effective method for secure state encoding of finite-state machine (FSM) based controllers to defend against power analysis attacks. Given a user-defined graded security metric, we derive constrained state encoding for the FSM controllers to mitigate information leakage through the power side-channel, resulting in low-power designs. Experimental results using over 100 FSMs from BenGen and MCNC benchmark suites show a graded increase in encoding length (40-70% for restructured FSMs) depending on the level of security chosen.

Fig. 1 shows the band diagram of a typical p-n junction-based TFET. The steep slope property can be realized by the energy filtering effect, where sharp onset of tunneling current is induced by the density-of-state overlap between the valence band of the source and the conduction band of the channel in n-channel TFETs. Thus, any defects in the bandgap such as bulk defects, tail states and interface states at MOS interfaces, generating possible leakage current paths, must be carefully eliminated. Also, the source impurity concentration and the steepness of the source impurity profile have to be sufficiently high, in order to thin the tunneling barrier width and to yield high tunneling current. Fig. 2 summarizes the critical issues and the device engineering of the p-n junction-based TFETs. While most of the requirements are shared with those of advanced CMOS devices, the device engineering inherent to TFET is the formation of the source tunnel junctions, as pointed out above. Here, the optimization of the source doping concentration and the spatial steepness of the dopant concentration profile are important in thinning tunneling barrier. In addition, the choice of the source and channel materials is quite important. Actually, Si-based TFETs have a difficulty in realizing low S.S. and high Ion, because of the low tunneling probability due to high and indirect bandgap. Thus, semiconductors such as Ge and III-V are expected as suitable materials with small and/or direct band gap for enhancing Ion of TFETs.

Space restrictions pose severe power supply considerations, to the point where just a few packet transmissions are sufficient to deplete state-of-the-art supplies. In turn, this translates to difficulties in developing efficient protocols even for basic operations, such as addressing and routing. The present work proposes a new network adapter architecture that can address these challenges. The BitSurfing adapter does not generate packets and, hence, abolishes the need for the corresponding transmission circuitry and power consumption. Instead, it relies on an external symbol generator. The BitSurfing adapter reads incoming symbols, waiting for intended messages to appear in the symbol stream. A short (1-bit), low-energy pulse is then emitted to notify neighboring nodes. BitSurfing adapters are shown to exhibit perpetual (and even battery-less) operation, ability to operate without medium access control, while being completely transparent to applications. Moreover, their operation is event-driven, allowing for clock-less implementations. The new adapters are evaluated in a simulated multi-hop nano-IoT network and are shown to offer nearly-perfect packet delivery rates and practically no collisions, under any congestion level.","2378-4873","978-1-5386-6151-2","10.1109/CAMAD.2018.8514984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514984","Nano-IoT;wireless;network adapter;low-complexity;energy-efficiency;security","Energy harvesting;Bit rate;Wireless communication;Mathematical model;Power supplies;Indexes;Batteries","","2","","20","IEEE","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Time series data is a major form where data is sequenced and indexed by timestamps. Multiple data mining techniques are applied to discover the behavior of time series datasets, periodic pattern mining is one of them. Many sequential pattern mining algorithms were presented, some of them built suffix trees and performed early pruning while other algorithms used pattern-growth techniques such as projection. A few algorithms performed Apriori-based techniques where lattice trees were built and traversed. However, most algorithms suffer from time and space issues when mining large scale time series sequences. In our paper, we present a solution that utilizes advanced and sophisticated distributed systems such as MapReduce framework. It splits the original sequence and distributes its segments across thousands of nodes in the MapReduce infrastructure. We use different training datasets to evaluate both traditional pattern mining algorithms and our MapReduce solution. After analyzing our solution in terms of time complexity, efficiency and accuracy, we clarify the advantages of processing data segments using periodic pattern mining along with MapReduce framework.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622063","Data Mining;Periodic pattern mining;MapReduce","Data mining;Time series analysis;Market research;Databases;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Big Data","","2","","29","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution engine and in-memory computing mechanism, Spark runs programs up to 100× faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10× faster on disk (Apache, 2016). However, Spark performance is impacted by many system software, hardware and dataset factors especially memory and JVM related, which makes capacity planning and tuning for Spark clusters extremely difficult. Current planning methods are mostly estimation based and are highly dependent on experience and trial-and-error. These approaches are far from efficient and accurate, especially with increasing software stack complexity and hardware diversity. Here, we propose a novel Spark simulator based on CSMethod (Bian et al., 2014), extension with a fine-grained multi-layered memory subsystem, well suitable for Spark cluster deployment planning, performance evaluation and optimization before system provisioning. The whole Spark application execution life cycle is simulated by the proposed simulator, including DAG generation, Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) processing and block management. Hardware activities derived from these software operations are dynamically mapped onto architecture models for processors, storage, and network devices. Performance behaviour of cluster memory system at multiple layers (Spark, JVM, OS, hardware) are modeled as an enhanced fine-grained individual global library. Experimental results with several popular Spark micro benchmarks and a real case IoT workloads demonstrate that our Spark Simulator achieves high accuracy with an average error rate below 7%. With light weight computing resource requirement (a laptop is enough) our simulator runs at the same speed level than native execution on multi-node high-end cluster.","","978-989-758-237-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7949406","Spark Simulation;Cluster Simulation;Performance Modelling;Memory Modelling;In-memory Computing;Big Data;Capacity Planning","Sparks;Computational modeling;Software;Hardware;Data models;Timing;Libraries","","","","18","","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most studies in the literature require the deployment of additional sensors for data collection. In this study, we propose to leverage available sensors built-in smartphones, to properly collect and broadcast data for different decision-making purposes in smart cities infrastructures, for example, intelligent transportation networks, smart health services, security and emergencies, industrial control, smart agriculture, home automation and so on. To this end, we first introduce our new platform (including software and mobile app implementation) to identify available sensors at each end-user device. We have identified a wide range of sensors including gyroscope, ambient light sensor, temperature, magnetic field sensor, orientation sensor, game rotation vector, linear acceleration, relative humidity, gravity, geomagnetic rotation vector, etc. As the sensors are already integrated within the phone, therefore, using these sensors can be beneficial considering the complexity, efficiency, and cost of the overall system. The challenge is to design a system that can trigger distributed devices to be self-activated and agreed to generate all available sensors data. Besides, as devices can send a continuous stream of data, therefore, size of data could be mounted and could be in the haphazard structure, which would give us hurdles to identify a device sensor data from another and to make an intelligent decision. To tackle all of these, we propose a distributed sensing approach that is capable to identify a device using token, can activate distributed end-user devices to send data to the cloud whenever it requires and store data in the cloud server maintaining proper format. This approach enables remote data collection leveraging available end-user devices and reduces the cost of installing new sensors for autonomous IoT applications. We then build on our efficient sensing platform to enable distributed intelligence among a network of smart devices. To this end, we leverage the computational capacity of these devices for local decision making, i.e., instead of broadcasting all sensing information to a centralized agent and solve a large-scale decision-making problem, each smart device communicates with a limited set of neighboring devices. This will also pave the way for implementing federated learning as a promising solution for distributed decision making.","","978-1-7281-5584-5","10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9071406","Internet of Things;autonomous decision making;federated learning;distributed algorithms;end-user devices;edge learning","Distributed databases;Intelligent sensors;Cloud computing;Sensor systems;Smart phones;Object recognition","","32","","25","IEEE","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work presents CBMA, a backscatter system that enables multiple concurrent backscatter tags to communicate reliably and efficiently. For the first time, we demonstrate that multiple tags can backscatter concurrently and efficiently with novel impedance-based power control at the tag, and can be successfully decoded with commodity WiFi devices without affecting the existing WiFi communication. We present the design details of CBMA and build a prototype with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and FPGA. The CBMA system achieves a 10-tag bit rate of 8Mbps while supporting a communication distance up to 10m.

Besides, we introduce a general formula for multi-level weighted election probability that can support up to n levels of heterogeneous nodes with their respective amounts of initial energies. For this, we leverage a state of the art heterogeneity method that considers more than three types of heterogeneous nodes and provides general models for higher levels of initial energy in WSNs. EH-mulSEP aims to minimize the total energy usage of battery-powered sensor nodes in IoT-based systems so as to maximize energy conservation, extend the network lifetime and ensure a higher level of scalability.

In the US context this problematic transition has been observed in students transferring from community colleges into the traditional university system. In Ireland's binary higher education structure, one set of institutions, known as Institutes of Technology (IoTs) allow for this transition to take place entirely within individual institutions. This paper is part of an ongoing investigation into one such IoT, where engineering students who achieve high grades at the end of 3-year (so-called Level 7) “ordinary degree” programs frequently transfer into the 3rd year of 4-year Level 8 “honors degree” programs, with surprisingly successful outcomes. One surprise derives from the fact that the students who enter Level 7 engineering programs are deemed at the outset to be academically less able, particularly in mathematics, than those who go directly into Level 8 programs from secondary school. Relatively little work has been done on this transition to date. In the 3rd and 4th year of many honors engineering programs within this institution it is not unusual to have 30–50% of the students coming from an ordinary degree background, the majority from within the institution itself — with others transferring from other IoTs in Ireland. Previous research has shown that students from this background initially struggle in the 3rd year of the honors degree program when compared with students who have proceeded directly through the honors program, before going on to successfully graduate. Can this be attributed to ‘transfer shock’ even though most of these students are continuing in an institution and with faculty that they are already familiar with? In order to examine this phenomenon we interview students from several engineering disciplines at various points in this transition. We explore the perceptions of the students regarding this transition and, based on the information coming from the interviews, we conduct a large scale survey to be administered to articulating students across engineering programs in the institution. The preliminary results of this survey are also presented here.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344365","articulation;transfer shock;engineering students","Interviews;Electric shock;Mathematics;Engineering students;Context;Medical services","","1","","13","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For most people air pollution is barely noticeable and the driver's impact is still unknown. The contribution of this paper consists in using new information and communication technology to create an in vehicle-IoT device giving the driver a real-time feedback on his emissions and on his exposure during his trips. This is achieved by coupling complex simulation models deployed on distant servers and the existing smartphone GNSS sensor in order to get a low-cost solution, compliant with large-scale deployment. Air quality exposure is estimated using an atmospheric urban dispersion model based on the driver real-time location. Vehicle pollutant emissions are computed for each second of the trip from the measured GNSS speed, position and altitude using models simulating the physical phenomena involved in pollutant formation.

Sensors, mobile and IoT devices, social networks, and online transactions are all generating data that can be monitored constantly to enable a business to detect and then act on events and insights before they lose their value. The need for large scale, real-time stream processing of big data in motion is more evident than ever before but the potential remains largely untapped by most firms.

They are efficient for reliable monitoring, giving farmers an edge to take precautionary measures. However, designing an energy-efficient WSN system requires a cross-layer effort and energy-aware routing protocols play a vital role in the overall energy optimization of a WSN. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical routing protocol suitable for large area environmental monitoring such as large-scale irrigation network existing in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The proposed protocol resolves the issues faced by traditional multi-hop routing protocols such as LEACH, M-LEACH and I-LEACH, and enhances the lifespan of each WSN node that results in an increased lifespan of the whole network.

Some previous approaches require explicit user inputs to label the locations of crowdsourced signals, which is inconvenient in practice. Others may rely on intensively-calibrated specialized sensors. Furthermore, the locations of crowdsourced signals are usually random and sparse, making it difficult to build a complete signal map. To address these, we propose Surecose, a novel signal map construction system by implicit crowdsourcing and interaction of low-cost cooperative sensors. Surecose is initialized with the light-weight sparse signal map collection. Having the background application on, the naive users are implicit surveyors unknowingly uploading crowdsourced signals. Phones may detect each other (mobile sensors), or beacons (fixed sensors). To label their locations, Surecose measures the mutual sensor proximity of the IoT devices. Via joint location labeling and sensor calibration, Surecose transparently locates the users despite devices used. Then Surecose constructs the database with a directionally and environmentally adapted Gaussian process, which scales the labeled locations and RSSIs anywhere into a complete signal map. Extensive experiments in diverse environments, including a campus hall, an international airport and a premium shopping mall, have validated that Surecose can adaptively and accurately construct the Wi-Fi signal map (often more than 20% reduction in RSSI construction error), with low survey cost (around 70% survey reduction) and little human intervention.","2155-5494","978-1-5090-6599-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2017.7964901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964901","","Sensors;Labeling;Mobile communication;Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Calibration;Databases","","8","","26","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, we have evaluated the errors between the measured data from D-LSA sensing system and data from the redesigned empirical models. Finally, the wireless quality performance in terms of received signal strength indication (RSSI) and packet receive rate (PDR) for blast wave monitoring is also verified.

Approximate computing achieves this goal leveraging the error tolerance features common in many emerging applications to reduce power consumption. In particular, adequate (i.e., energy/quality-configurable) hardware operators are key components in an error tolerant system. Existing implementations of these operators require significant architectural modifications, hence they are often design-specific and tend to have large overheads compared to accurate units. In this paper, we propose a methodology to design adequate data-path operators in an automatic way, which uses threshold voltage scaling as a knob to dynamically control the power/accuracy tradeoff. The method overcomes the limitations of previous solutions based on supply voltage scaling, in that it introduces lower overheads and it allows fine-grain regulation of this tradeoff. We demonstrate our approach on a state-of-the-art 28nm FDSOI technology, exploiting the strong effect of back biasing on threshold voltage. Results show a power consumption reduction of as much as 39% compared to solutions based only on supply voltage scaling, at iso-accuracy.","1558-1101","978-3-9815370-8-6","10.23919/DATE.2017.7927165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927165","","Delays;Hardware;Power demand;Silicon-on-insulator;Adders;Threshold voltage","","8","","20","","15 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The APT has the characteristics of long duration, complex attack means, and strong ability to conceal themselves, which make it difficult to detect them. Due to the lack of proper means to protect the Information-centric IoT (ICIoT), the ICIoT devices are extremely vulnerable to APT attacks. Moreover, among the existing APT detection methods, most researchers adopt those that extract the features of different APT attacks, and most of the features extracted are local, which leads to the fact that the related methods have poor scalability, thus reducing the accuracy. Furthermore, the attackers can easily avoid the detection by changing the local features. In this paper, we find that it is inevitable that the infected host will generate C&C communication with the command and control server (C&C server), during the process of APT attacks, and the C&C domain names are the bridge connecting the internal infection with the C&C server. Moreover, a certain APT attack of one attack family, which is the assembly of the same APT attacks, tends to map the C&C domain names to the same IP subnet. Under the assumption that the APT attackers have limited attack resources, the relationship between C&C domain names of APT and IP subnet is inevitable for the APT attackers to get higher attack efficiency, which leads to the effective tracking of APT attack behavior. Therefore, we construct a detection method based on the domain names' graph structure. This detection method can improve the detection efficiency in the information-centric internet, especially for the IoT devices. And, at the same time, we employ an appropriate pruning strategy and a preprocessing method to reduce the size of data to be processed and improve the computational efficiency. This detection method can also reduce the detection range, increase the detection accuracy, and improve the robustness and scalability of the detection system. In the actual experiment, the data size we process is 257535071 DNS requests and 73136 domain names. The experiment shows that the C&C domain names can be effectively detected even with a small-scale seed domain names.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2894509","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772229,61472162); Scientific and Technological Research Planning Projects in Colleges and Universities of Jilin Province(grant numbers:JJKH20190168KJ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624251","APT;malicious domain;graph;ICIoT;C&C server","Feature extraction;IP networks;Computer crime;Scalability;Servers;Tools;Command and control systems","","17","","23","OAPA","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, approximate computing has been introduced to address the energy-efficiency problems of error tolerant applications in all forms of computing from mobile IoT devices to datacenters and servers. This technique has proved successful in various application domains such as digital signal processing, deep machine learning, and combinatorial optimization. Approximate computing trades accuracy for power, delay, and area in computing systems. One key arithmetic circuit in digital signal processing is multi-bit digital adder that is widely used in today's user applications. Adders consume significant amounts of system energy and occupy large portions of the processor die area. The need for low power and high-speed circuits as well as the error-resiliency of the digital signal processing systems allow the system designers to innovate energy-efficient approximate adders. This paper examines DrAx, a design remedy for approximation, which provides an automatic method to improve the accuracy of approximate adders with virtually no impact on their power and area consumption. The proposed method is applied to seven state-of-the-art approximate adders for evaluation; our simulation results indicate 12–50% accuracy regarding mean error distance metric improvements are attainable for the baseline approximate adders using the proposed design approach.","","978-1-5386-1475-4","10.1109/RTEST.2018.8397073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397073","Approximate Computing;Energy-efficiency;Internet of Things","Adders;Logic gates;Error correction;Digital signal processing;Power demand;Complexity theory;Approximate computing","","4","","24","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such platforms are resource-intensive, relatively expensive, and lead to longer response time due to network latency. Hence, cloud computing may not always be suitable for unusually large scale deployment. Various edge computing solutions have been proposed to overcome the above issues. However, most of such solutions rely upon expensive edge servers, which make them unsuitable for distributed applications like image recognition in agricultural fields. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical edge computing-based image recognition system in which the major processing is carried out at low-cost gateway devices like Raspberry Pi. As an example case, we address the issue of recognition of animals intruding in agricultural fields. We implement a dynamic learning method, in which a convolutional neural network is dynamically trained to recognize potential target classes based on a specific deployment environment. The AI detection module is then loaded on to the lowest level of edge servers on gateway devices for detection of animals and providing feedback. Experiments show that our proposed recognition system can perform offline image classification tasks with up to seven times higher accuracy and more than two times faster evaluation time in comparison with general-purpose cloud recognition systems. Besides, it consumes less than 6% of the network bandwidth and only a fraction of the energy as well as other computational resources compared with existing approaches.","","978-1-7281-1019-6","10.1109/INCIT.2019.8912138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8912138","Edge Computing;Image Recognition;Internet of Things","Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Animals;Image edge detection;Edge computing;Servers","","3","","28","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address this problem by distributing the deep learning pipeline across edge and cloudlet/fog resources.

The proposed approach performs initial processing of the data close to the data source at edge and fog nodes, resulting in significant reduction in the data that is transferred and stored in the cloud.

For that purpose, this paper describes the design and deployment of a low-cost IoT monitoring system to collect data in a Smart district.

The wireless communication between the distributed sensor devices and the host stations can consume significant energy, even more when data needs to reach several kilometers of distance. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient multi-sensing platform that exploits energy harvesting, long-range communication and ultra-low-power short-range wake-up radio to achieve self sustainability in a kilometer range network. The proposed platform is designed with power efficiency in mind and exploits the always-on wake-up radio as both receiver and a power management unit to significantly reduce the quiescent current even continuously listening the wireless channel. Moreover the platform allows the building of an heterogeneous long-short range network architecture to reduce the latency and reduce the power consumption in listening phase at only 4.6 μW.

Traditional solutions, which generally rely on specialized sensors, suffer from intrusive deployment, high cost, and high power consumption. Such problems prohibit applying those solutions for large-scale and continuously industrial monitoring. In this work, we present a RFID-based solution, TwinLeak, to detect liquid leakage using COTS RFID devices. Detecting the leakage accurately with coarse-grained RSSI and phase readings of tags has been a daunting task, which is especially challenging when low detection delay is required. Our system achieves these goals based on the fact that the inductive coupling between two adjacent tags is highly sensitive to the liquid leaked between them. Therefore, instead of judging according to the signals of each individual tag, TwinLeak utilizes the relationship between the signals of two tags as an effective feature for leakage detection. Specifically, Twin-Leak extracts discriminative signal features from short segments of signals and instantly identifies leakage using a light-weight classifier. A model-guided method for leakage progress tracking is further devised to simultaneously estimate the leakage volume and rate. We implement TwinLeak, evaluate its performance across various scenarios, and deploy it in a real-world industrial IoT system. In average, TwinLeak achieves a TPR higher than 97.2%, a FPR lower than 0.5%, and a relative property estimation error around 10%, while triggering early alarms after only about 4.6mL liquid leaks.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-0515-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737621","","Liquids;Couplings;Feature extraction;Cotton;Radiofrequency identification;Humidity","","30","","20","IEEE","17 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Datacenter optimizations are required to address the growth challenges with acceptable Quality of Services (QoS) at a reasonable cost. Datacenters are characterized by heterogeneous hardware platforms and a number of homogeneous servers to execute tasks having distinct characteristics such as time, origin, density and class of service. Large scale datacenters need efficient mechanisms to handle incoming requests by ensuring availability of optimal number of servers. Otherwise, it may result in poor QoS and/or unstable economy of operations due to idle or under-utilized servers. A suitable load distribution mechanism helps in minimizing unnecessary resource consumption, addressing failures, scalability, eliminating bottlenecks and overprovisioning etc. and hence enhances overall performance. There are various techniques such as non-proactive or reactive load balancing to address these challenges in datacenters. This paper implements an Erlang based approach to control server allocation in Software Defined Networking (SDN) based datacenters. The proposed approach handles the aforementioned challenges using proactive use of Erlang distribution of services along with centralized control plane architecture of SDN, thus maximizing energy efficiency, and ensuring optimal performance of services.

Despite their success, they suffer from high energy requirements. In recent years, the inherent error resiliency of DNNs has been exploited by introducing approximations at either the algorithmic or the hardware levels (individually) to obtain energy savings while incurring tolerable accuracy degradation. However, there is a need for investigating the overall energy-accuracy trade-offs arising from the introduction of approximations at different levels in complex DNNs. We perform a comprehensive analysis to determine the effectiveness of cross-layer approximations for the energy-efficient realization of large-scale DNNs. The approximations considered are as follows: 1) use of lower complexity networks (containing lesser number of layers and/or neurons per layer); 2) pruning of synaptic weights; 3) approximate multiplication operation in the neuronal multiply-and-accumulate computation; and 4) approximate write/read operations to/from the synaptic memory. Our experiments on recognition benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR10) show that cross-layer approximation provides substantial improvements in energy efficiency for different accuracy/quality requirements. Furthermore, we propose a synergistic framework for combining the approximation techniques to achieve maximal energy benefits from approximate DNNs.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2018.2835809","Center for Brain-inspired Computing, one of six centers in JUMP; Semiconductor Research Corporation; National Science Foundation; Intel Corporation; Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358698","Alphabet set multiplier (ASM);energy efficiency;network complexity;pruning;shallow network;hybrid 8T-6T SRAM;neural computing","Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Hardware;Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;Synapses","","32","","35","IEEE","14 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data coming from the IoT, from scientific simulations, or from any other field of the eScience, are accumulated over historical data sets and set up the seed for future Big Data processing, with the final goal to generate added value and discover knowledge. In such computing processes, data are the main resource, however, organizing and managing data during their entire life cycle becomes a complex research topic. As part of this, Data LifeCycle (DLC) models have been proposed to efficiently organize large and complex data sets, from creation to consumption, in any field, and any scale, for an effective data usage and big data exploitation. 2. Several DLC frameworks can be found in the literature, each one defined for specific environments and scenarios. However, we realized that there is no global and comprehensive DLC model to be easily adapted to different scientific areas. For this reason, in this paper we describe the Comprehensive Scenario Agnostic Data LifeCycle (COSA-DLC) model, a DLC model which: i) is proved to be comprehensive as it addresses the 6Vs challenges (namely Value, Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Veracity, and ii), it can be easily adapted to any particular scenario and, therefore, fit the requirements of a specific scientific field. In this paper we also include two use cases to illustrate the ease of the adaptation in different scenarios. We conclude that the comprehensive scenario agnostic DLC model provides several advantages, such as facilitating global data management, organization and integration, easing the adaptation to any kind of scenario, guaranteeing good data quality levels and, therefore, saving design time and efforts for the scientific and industrial communities.","","978-1-4503-4617-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7877056","Big Data;Data LifeCycle;Data Management;Data Organization;Data Complexity;Vs Challenges","Data models;Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Big Data;Organizations;Data acquisition;Computational modeling","","","","29","","16 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a design methodology for finite state controllers (FSMs) to defend against power analysis attacks while ensuring low power overhead. Further, a desired level of security can be achieved while minimizing power consumption. We formulate a set of constraints on state encoding based on security and power metrics. We express these constraints as a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem and use a SAT solver to generate constraint satisfying encodings. Using over 100 FSMs from BenGen and MCNC benchmark suites, experimental results show an average power reduction of up to 40% with respect to secure-only FSMs and 4-20% reduction with respect to minimal encoding strategy.

Reaching this level of performance is subject to several engineering challenges such as energy consumption, equipment-cooling, reliability and massive parallelism. Model-based optimization is an essential tool in the design process and control of energy efficient, reliable and thermally constrained systems. However, in the Exascale domain, model learning techniques tailored to the specific supercomputer require real measurements and must therefore handle and analyze a massive amount of data coming from the HPC monitoring infrastructure. This becomes rapidly a “big data” scale problem. The common approach where measurements are first stored in large databases and then processed is no more affordable due to the increasingly storage costs and lack of real-time support. Nowadays instead, cloud-based machine learning techniques aim to build on-line models using real-time approaches such as “stream processing” and “in-memory” computing, that avoid storage costs and enable fastdata processing. Moreover, the fast delivery and adaptation of the models to the quick data variations, make the decision stage of the optimization loop more effective and reliable. In this paper we leverage scalable, lightweight and flexible IoT technologies, such as the MQTT protocol, to build a highly scalable HPC monitoring infrastructure able to handle the massive sensor data produced by next-gen HPC components. We then show how state-of-the art tools for big data computing and analysis, such as Apache Spark, can be used to manage the huge amount of data delivered by the monitoring layer and to build adaptive models in real-time using on-line machine learning techniques.","1558-1101","978-3-9815370-8-6","10.23919/DATE.2017.7927143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927143","","Monitoring;Computational modeling;Data models;Tools;Real-time systems;Mathematical model;Protocols","","30","","17","","15 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities","",,"2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","23 Oct 2017","2017","","","xi","xiv","In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of Dny for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.","","978-1-5090-3982-1","10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8075923","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While it promises outstandingly positive usability and convenience effects, its implications for security and privacy are less clear. The vision of billions of low-cost, lightweight, and highly interconnected endpoints certainly rises a host of pressing issues to both cryptographers and system designers. Ideally, these should be resolved prior to a large-scale deployment of the IoT, and before its underlying infrastructure and standards have been established.

Differentiated from 4G, a benefit offered by 5G is much more than the increased maximum throughput. It aims to involve and benefit from many current technical advances including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the IIoT integrates many heterogeneous networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Mobile Communication Networks (3G/4G/LTE/5G), Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and wearable health care systems, it is critical to design self-organizing and smart protocols for heterogeneous ad hoc networks in various IoT applications, such as cyber-physical systems, cloud computing for heterogeneous ad hoc networks, large-scale sensor networks, data acquisition from distributed smart devices, green communication and applications, environmental monitoring and control, etc. Moreover, based on the survey conducted by the World Health Organization, the world will lack 12.9 million healthcare workers by 2035. Hence, it is important to develop wearable healthcare systems to perform self-health monitoring. In general, wearable healthcare systems demands low power consumption and high measurement accuracy. Smart technologies including green electronics, green radios, fuzzy neural approaches and intelligent signal processing techniques play important roles in the developments of the wearable healthcare systems. Therefore, this special issue provides a forum to discuss the recent advances on 5G and beyond mobile technologies and applications for IIoT.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2018.2823311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331934","","Special issues and sections;Wearable computers;Wireless communication;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Informatics;Long Term Evolution","","63","","","IEEE","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From hardware designer’s point of view, a communication system could be a system with DSP (Digital Signal Processor, including digital ASIC, Application Specific Integrated Circuit and FPGA) + MCU (Micro Controller Unit) surrounded with analog/digital interfaces, including ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) and RFIC (Radio Frequency IC) modules. ICs are core components for communications. IC based on VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) has been the essential technology supporting telecommunications and it is growing rapidly in the last 20 years. It will definitely keep their high growing pace in the next decade. The involved R&D covers mobile communications, highway (core network) and last-mile (access network) broadband communication, and other domain specific communications. Radio communication steps into its new generation in every 10 years, the bandwidth has been 1Gbps and will be 10Gbps of 5G in the next 10 years. The bandwidth of broadband communication will soon reach 400Gbps per port. All of these challenges are drivers of R&D of high-end IC for communications. At the same time, R&D of low cost IC is also driven by volume communication markets including IoT (Internet of Things, including ZegBee, WIA-PA), Bluetooth, NFC (Near Field Communication, such as BAN: Body Area Communication, RFID), and other emerging technologies. Challenges on another side are low cost and low power consumption.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2015.7112050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112050","","Special issues and sections;Integrated circuits;Telecommuincation services","","","","","","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Sensing provides the information gateway to achieve this coupling between object and environment, as well as their interaction. This understanding has fuelled considerable research efforts on intelligent and sensor-equipped structures. Among the obstacles that impede their introduction are economic ones. Material rather than component-integrated sensing and intelligence has the potential to circumnavigate some of the obstacles by paving the way to economy-of-scale effects [1], [2]. Such concepts have been known for a considerable time [3]. This Special Issue on Material-Integrated Sensing, Data Processing and Communication is based on a Symposium held at the IEEE SENSORS 2012 Conference, Taipei, Taiwan, October 28–31, for which we defined our own vision of intelligent materials; perceptive matter, as we envisage it, must have the ability to gather data on its own state and environment, process this data and communicate the information derived internally or to a higher level system component. To do so, it must in itself be a complex system with sensing as basic functionality.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2330133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6842732","","Special issues and sections;Internet of Things;Data integration;Sensor systems and applications","","","","5","IEEE","24 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technological advances that have sustained the exponential growth of computing performance over the last several decades are slowing and the roadmap for future advances is uncertain. The phenomenal expansion of computing power has made computers ubiquitous, spawned a $300 billion semiconductor industry, enabled unprecedented global economic growth, and transformed many aspects of society at large. Emerging technologies are placing an ever-growing and changing demand on computing, especially the profusion of data from the Internet of Things, large-scale scientific experiments (high-energy physics, astronomy, and genomics), autonomous vehicles, social media (including video), national security systems, and the finance sector. Transmitting, storing, processing, and analyzing this data explosion with the requisite speed and performance—and enabling significant processing and analysis to occur locally or at network nodes (i.e., edge computing)—may require a radical departure from the traditional computing paradigm of von Neumann computing architectures running on CMOS-based digital logic. New paradigms will likely require a range of new devices, software, design and simulation tools, and benchmarking, and may ultimately require rethinking the tasks that computing machines undertake. Recently, government, industry, and academia collectively have recognized that the future of computing requires a new, multidisciplinary research and development agenda.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2018.2884780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591943","","Special issues and sections;Computational modeling;Data storage systems;Computer architecture;Deep learning;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence","","14","","22","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This was the clear message of a conference sponsored by market research firm IDTechEx, held in Santa Clara, Calif., last November, where seven events took place at once. In addition to energy harvesting and storage, the topics covered were printed electronics, wearable technology, 3-D printing, supercapacitors, the Internet of Things, and graphene. These seemingly disparate fields are tightly linked; for example, as IDTechEx CEO Raghu Das pointed out, wearable devices were a strong driver for energy-harvesting technologies. Throughout the sessions and in the exhibit hall, other linkages were evident: Supercapacitors hold the potential to create highly efficient ways to store and release harvested energy, and 3-D printing plays a big role in creating prototypes and short-run custom production items.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2015.7065409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065409","","","","6","","","IEEE","24 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The amount of data generated and collected across computing platforms every day is not only enormous, but growing at an exponential rate. Advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques have become increasingly essential to analyze and extract meaning from such “Big Data”. These techniques can be very useful to detect patterns and trends to improve the operational behavior of computing systems, but they also introduce a number of outstanding challenges: (1) How can we design and deploy data analytics mechanisms to improve energy-efficiency and reliability in IoT and mobile devices, without introducing significant software overheads? (2) How to leverage emerging technologies (e.g.,3D integration) to design energy-efficient and reliable manycore systems for big data computing? (3) How to use machine learning and data mining techniques for effective design space exploration of computing systems, and enable adaptive control to improve energy-efficiency? (4) How can data analytics detect anomalies and increase robustness in the network backbone of emerging large-scale networking systems? To address these outstanding challenges, out-of-the-box approaches need to be explored. In this special session, we will discuss these outstanding problems and describe far-reaching solutions applicable across the interconnected ecosystem of IoT and mobile devices, manycore chips, datacenters, and networks. The special session brings together speakers with unique insights on applying data analytics and machine learning to real-world problems to achieve the most sought after features on multi-scale computing platforms, viz. intelligent data mining, energyefficiency, and robustness. By integrating data analytics and machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, embedded hardware and software design, and cloud computing content, this session will engage a broad section of Embedded and VLSI Design conference attendees. This special session is targeted towards university researchers/professors, students, industry professionals, and embedded/VLSI system designers.
